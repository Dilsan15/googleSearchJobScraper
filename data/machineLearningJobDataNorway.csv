For a position as a PhD Candidate, the goal is a completed doctoral education up to an obtained doctoral degree.

The PhD Candidate will research methods for explainable machine learning in the context of health management, with an emphasis on causality, Bayesian networks, and related techniques from artificial intelligence (AI). The candidate will obtain a deeper insight into research questions, concepts, and techniques associated with the concept of cause-and-effect in AI, including relationships to other methods and models used in AI. The goal of the project is to develop new AI methods that will help to improve the understanding and management of diabetes, specifically gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Women with increased risk of GDM will be engaged in managing their own health. The purpose of this is for them to improve their metabolic health before and during pregnancy, based on new insights obtained by using machine learning (ML) models created from... real-world GDM data.

Existing data from a lifestyle intervention trial in women with increased risk for GDM, BEFORE THE BEGINNING (BTB), will be used. This project will complement the clinical trial with explainable causal ML models for prediction: Using BTB data and explainable ML models and methods developed in this project, predictions at an early stage of pregnancy (or before pregnancy) can be made as to which women are at high risk of developing GDM. Such predictions, taking into consideration health management evidence and activities, would be of great clinical value.

The project is a collaboration between Ole Jakob Mengshoel at Department of Computer Science at NTNU and Trine Moholdt at the Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging at NTNU.

• complement an on-going randomised controlled trial at the Faculty of Medicine and Health (the BTB project);
• improve and develop explainable causal ML-models for prediction of GDM and its progression of comorbidities in order to provide patient-tailored treatment plans (nutrition, medication, exercise, etc.);
• discover correlation and causation in bio-data, including clinical outcomes, from women with increased risk of GDM and possible comorbidities based on collected data in the on-going BTB project; and
• establish close collaborations with researchers, other PhD candidates, and MS students working on similar projects in both departments.

Our mission

Aquabyte is on a mission to revolutionize the sustainability and efficiency of aquaculture. It is an audacious, and incredibly rewarding mission. By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest... growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the sea for generations to come.

We are a diverse, mission-driven team that is eager to work alongside kindred spirits. If this vision makes you smile, gives you goosebumps, or otherwise inspires you please get in touch.

Our product

We are currently focused on helping Norwegian salmon farmers better understand their fish populations and make environmentally-sound decisions. Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect sea lice infestations, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time. Our product operates at three levels: on-site hardware for image capture, cloud pipelines for data processing, and a user-facing web application. As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack.

Above all, Aquabyte is a customer-driven company. Our product development is dictated by the needs of fish farmers and we prioritize customer delight in everything we do.

Qualifications
• Bachelor's degree equivalent in a relevant field.
• Interest in or work experience from aquaculture.
• Excellent problem solving and analytical skills.
• Ability to work across timezones.

Benefits
• Competitive salaries and generous equity

For a position as a PhD Candidate, the goal is a completed doctoral education up to an obtained doctoral degree.

This project aims to develop new and world-leading methods for online machine learning model predictive control (MPC) for motion control systems.

Model predictive control is a control method that uses an internal model (in the form of a set of differential equations) and an optimality criterion to predict the best series of control actions by solving an optimization problem.

MPC has been used for decades to control relatively slow industrial processes. However, increasing computational power and innovative new algorithms have made it feasible for the much more time-sensitive domain of motion control.

A key aspect of MPC is its internal model, used to predict the future behavior of the system it tries to control. For complex systems, however, obtaining accurate models is challenging, particularly in changing and ill-structured environments and when around... humans and other unpredictable actors.

Combining first principles-based models with machine learning (ML) models is a way of overcoming these challenges. Recent developments in neural ODEs, online ML, and automatic differentiation have enabled the integration of these in an MPC formulation. However, significant and exciting challenges remain to bring the methods to fruition.

You will be doing cutting-edge research on this project, including theoretical, simulation-based, and experimental. You will be working alone and in small teams under the supervision of an expert in the field. You will be publishing your research in high-level peer-reviewed conferences and journals.

The ultimate end point of your work is obtaining a PhD. A PhD is the highest academic degree in the Norwegian system. A PhD program is both a study program and a paid research position with a three-year duration.

Your immediate leader is Associate Professor Christian Holden

• perform analysis of said methods
• write and publish results of research at high-level peer-reviewed conferences and journals
• pass 30 ECTS credits of PhD-level or high-level university courses
• write a PhD thesis, and defend it in front of a committee of experts

Required selection criteria
• you must have a professionally relevant background in robotics and automation, machine learning, control theory and cybernetics, or applied mathematics
