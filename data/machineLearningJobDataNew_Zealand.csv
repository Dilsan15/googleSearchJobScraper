We do this by turning real-world farming problems into software with the use of smart hardware, and a cloud-based system to more efficiently run these farms. Our world-first technology helps farmers break free from the time-intensive constraints of conventional farming and empowers a more sustainable future for farmers, their animals, and the land. Halter gives farmers the freedom to spend more time with their families, the technology to increase production and meet the growing demand for food, and the data to help them care for their animals.

Founded in 2016, Halter has developed a revolutionary farm management system. We fit our solar-powered GPS-enabled smart collars to every cow on the farm. We then equip farmers with a simple app for managing their cows. This system enables farmers to remotely shift, virtually fence and proactively monitor their cow’s... health, feed and behaviour - all through their phones. Scaling rapidly onto farms across New Zealand, we have the privilege of working together with exceptional farmers including some of the largest farms in the country. We care deeply for our farmers and their animals, with our customers heavily involved in product development and animal welfare core to our culture.

Our work is turning heads. In 2021, Halter won in two categories at the NZ Hi-Tech Awards. Our Board comprises tier 1 Silicon Valley investors who have backed the world's best technology companies such as SpaceX, Tesla, Airbnb and Spotify. We’re also fortunate to have Rocket Lab CEO, Peter Beck, as an investor and Board member. We hire the world's best people and provide an epic environment for them to thrive in. Our culture is unique; we care about high performance, about each other, and we're passionate about making a difference for our customers.

About the role

Each day we process millions of points of telemetry data from animals across the country on our customer farms. Our rich datasets and deep industry knowledge allows us to build market-leading models that continuously monitor and predict animal behaviour.

A collective of specialists driven by our shared mission to help establish Xero as the most insightful and trusted small business platform. Our backgrounds and work are diverse—we work on data platforms, data modelling, application development, applied research, ethics, literacy, and strategy, to name a few. At the heart of our mission is helping our colleagues and customers get value from data responsibly, on robust data platforms, with robust methods.

Applied Scientists work in cross-functional teams (engineers, designers, product managers, etc) to create AI-powered experiences. We apply machine learning to develop products that reduce toil and provide insight, allowing small businesses to focus on what matters.

There’s a myriad of job titles out there and the English language can only express so much in a couple of words. So role title aside, what we’re looking for is someone to:

About the role:
• Provide leadership to cross-functional teams that build... web-scale ML products
• Work with your peers and the Data Leadership Team to define the roadmap for Applied Sciences
• Identify cross-cutting opportunities to create frameworks / tooling and improve data quality
• Work with other scientists to figure out the best practices for reproducible and robust science, before documenting and evangelising them
• Keep up-to-date with the latest developments in ML, identifying opportunities for Xero to improve #beautiful products.
• Be comfortable with pushing the frontiers of ML in the pursuit of delivering products, but only where absolutely necessary
• Teach colleagues around Xero about how use data the right way

• Mentor, manage, and develop other scientists and colleagues

About you:
• You have extensive experience delivering web-scale production machine learning systems
• You rejoice in identifying tough problems that can be solved with scientific thinking
• You understand that solving worthwhile problems means covering all areas of the data lifecycle - finding it, understanding it, experimenting with it, despairing over it, fixing it, …
• You’re comfortable reading ML research papers, keep abreast of new work on arXiv.org and have on occasion spent your time tinkering around with that interesting new framework you read about recently ... but when it comes down to it, you want to solve real business problems in the simplest and most robust way possible
• You’re comfortable working with experts from all corners of the company to deeply understand the customer problem before getting your hands dirty with all that data and code
• Experience as a hands-on practitioner building productionized machine learning pipelines which touch real human end users
• You have a solid grasp of statistics and you have wrestled with the challenges inherent in actually measuring the impact of your machine learning pipelines in the wild
• You’ve learned through experience that it’s important to write testable, repeatable code so you can debug it when something goes bump in the night
• You know your way around the ‘nix command line, ssh your way happily around your multiple running AWS instances and are a competent programmer in Python, Scala or similar
• You’ve mentored and grown teams of applied scientists, teaching the skills of scientific reasoning, collaboration, and effective program delivery.

What you'll bring:
• Ability to translate between the business and machine learning domains
• Sound software engineering skills in Python, Scala, or similar
