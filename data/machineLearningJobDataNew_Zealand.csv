We do this by turning real-world farming problems into software with the use of smart hardware, and a cloud-based system to more efficiently run these farms. Our world-first technology helps farmers break free from the time-intensive constraints of conventional farming and empowers a more sustainable future for farmers, their animals, and the land. Halter gives farmers the freedom to spend more time with their families, the technology to increase production and meet the growing demand for food, and the data to help them care for their animals.

Founded in 2016, Halter has developed a revolutionary farm management system. We fit our solar-powered GPS-enabled smart collars to every cow on the farm. We then equip farmers with a simple app for managing their cows. This system enables farmers to remotely shift, virtually fence and proactively monitor their cow’s... health, feed and behaviour - all through their phones. Scaling rapidly onto farms across New Zealand, we have the privilege of working together with exceptional farmers including some of the largest farms in the country. We care deeply for our farmers and their animals, with our customers heavily involved in product development and animal welfare core to our culture.

Our work is turning heads. In 2021, Halter won in two categories at the NZ Hi-Tech Awards. Our Board comprises tier 1 Silicon Valley investors who have backed the world's best technology companies such as SpaceX, Tesla, Airbnb and Spotify. We’re also fortunate to have Rocket Lab CEO, Peter Beck, as an investor and Board member. We hire the world's best people and provide an epic environment for them to thrive in. Our culture is unique; we care about high performance, about each other, and we're passionate about making a difference for our customers.

About the role

Each day we process millions of points of telemetry data from animals across the country on our customer farms. Our rich datasets and deep industry knowledge allows us to build market-leading models that continuously monitor and predict animal behaviour. The insights we provide transform the way farmers manage the health and movement of their animals.

Project Description

The goal is to develop a predictive machine learning models for (upcoming) social unrest at the local/regional/subnational level the United States, beginning with New York city, and other region. There are several existing risk indices at either a country level or at a city level (e.g. Lloyd’s City Index https://cityriskindex.lloyds.com/). Most of these are based on economic factors, although recently political instability and other factors are being considered. However, they rarely use online language data, which Peloria has found to be highly associated with enhanced model predictive accuracy in its work elsewhere (see Peloria’s website for some examples). Such indices are used by government and businesses to decide where to locate or mainstream new and existing... operations as well as governments to better identify the location, scale, nature and timing of development activities. Insurance companies have developed their own risk indices based on claims paid out and other macro-economic data. For the most part, however, such indices reflect subjective interpretation, particularly in regard to issues surrounding governance, globalization, and social group specific exclusion.

Welcome to the Post Pollution Future with LanzaTech

A post-pollution world is inevitable, and people will either be part of it, or the planet will go on without us. At LanzaTech, our technology platform is transforming waste carbon into everyday products, to meet the needs of this moment. Our science is state-of-the-art, but the idea is simple. We use nature to heal nature. We capture carbon emissions which are then fed into bioreactors where trillions of carbon-hungry microbes go to work. These tiny dynamos consume the... waste gases and produce valuable raw material commodities. Pure enough to be resold, repurposed, and recycled again — from sustainable jet fuel to beverage bottles, to yoga pants.

Founded in New Zealand, we are a global women-led company with an international footprint and a diverse employee population. Diversity, Equity & Inclusion are a key part of our mission and core values which we show through our hiring, our leadership, our efforts to educate internally and willingness to learn.

Job description

We have two exciting summer internship opportunities for a machine learning engineer in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) group at LanzaTech. The AI group uses artificial intelligence and computational modelling to design and control LanzaTech’s carbon-recycling microbes and processes. The group also tackles other important projects at LanzaTech. Colleagues in the group include scientists and software/machine learning/data engineers. The group owns the full stack from research to deployment, and you will collaborate closely with all these roles to deliver solutions.

Project 1 : Applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in monitoring and automation of gas fermentation.

LanzaTech’s fermentation processes generate large volumes of data. To achieve higher productivity under optimal resource utilization, we explore AI and ML-driven solutions for a variety of use cases including real-time time series prediction models, and anomaly detection.

Our time series data streams inherit many challenges including engineering and wrangling large volume of data flow, coping with potential feature and concept drifts, and making real-time model predictions. In this project, we aim to design, build, and deploy ML models that assist in improving fermentation performance. Additionally, we propose a data and model monitoring system to ensure consistently well-performing models.

Project 2 : Developing software for supporting protein engineering machine learning models.

LanzaTech’s biocatalysts are constructed by borrowing genetic material from diverse microbial organisms. To achieve this task, it is necessary to adapt these genes so they can perform optimally in the host organism under the specific environmental conditions faced during LanzaTech processes. While this adaptation is traditionally performed through laboratory experiments, it is possible to make use of machine learning methods to design the best protein sequence variants to utilize.

This project proposes to take part in the building of a python library to assess the potential for a given dataset to be successful for computer-based enzyme engineering. A focus will be given on the estimation and the quantification of the uncertainty of different modelling strategies.

Skills required:

Technical : Python Programming, Machine Learning, Statistics, Time Series Analysis, Code Documentation, Deep Learning (preferred), Predictive Analytics (preferred).

General : Effective Communication and Collaboration skills, Time Management, Problem-solving skills and Curiosity.

Program dates:

A total of 10 weeks full-time work over summer 2022-2023.

Location:

Remote working within New Zealand, occasional meetings in Auckland.
Company Benefits:
● Learning opportunities
● Advancement opportunities
● Advantageous package

● Remote Work opportunity"
