What’s hype commerce, we hear you ask?! It’s a fair question, especially since EQL is the first of its kind!
Hype commerce happens when there’s a massive spike in demand for a limited-run product or one-off experience. If you’ve ever tried to get your hands on a pair of Jordans, coveted handbags and accessories that everyone lusts after, or a ticket to a footy final, you know what happens next.
Fans and bots rush the retailer’s site. The thing you thought you had in your cart disappears. You desperately click ‘next’, and after staring at a spinner for the longest time, you get forcibly logged out and end up back on the homepage. Five minutes later, you’ve got a $500 hold on your credit card but nothing to show for it. Soon you’ll be turning to the resale market in desperation…
This is where EQL comes in. We’re on a mission to build the world’s first and fairest hype commerce platform for both fans and retailers.
Our platform... helps global brands and retailers maximize these high-intensity retail moments. We provide hype-scale infrastructure, bot and scammer detection and robust checkout management so that sites don’t crash, scammers are squeezed out, and REAL fans win. We do this using a bunch of extremely cool and innovative technologies, and we’re constantly iterating to improve the fan experience. We’ve raised capital from leading VCs and angel investors across the world who believe in our mission and who are as excited about solving this pain for our customers as we are.
Who we are
EQL is a place where people can thrive and bring their whole selves to work while solving some really cool challenges. It’s fun, it’s hard, it’s the bravest thing we’ve done, and we are looking for brilliant people to do it with us. We know that we’ll win by building a company of talented, curious people to help us tackle the gnarly hurdles we know are coming. Over the last 12 months we’ve already managed to find some of the best, brightest, and most importantly kindest out there and we want to continue that trend! If you think you might be one of these people, we’d love to have you on board.
We know that when applying for jobs, it is very common for people, particularly women or those from minority groups, to focus on their gaps and weaknesses, rather than their strengths. If you’re passionate about EQL’s mission but you don’t feel totally confident you meet all our selection criteria, we strongly encourage you to apply anyway.
What we value
EQL was founded by three passionate fans who wanted to build a product and a company founded on fairness. The values that our product embodies are also part of our workplace culture:
Fairness is our power: We’ve built fairness into our product, we live it in our work. We are creating a place where everyone is treated with respect and where we trust our teammates.
We thrive when you thrive: We value an inclusive workplace that embraces everyone’s style. With a flexible work environment, we want you to work in the way that best suits you.
Chaos is our opportunity: Opportunity is found in the world of chaotic online behaviours. That’s why we built EQL; that’s how together, we’ll find those next big wins.
But truthfully, we’re most excited about working with awesome people to solve fan and retailer pain. If you’re one of those great people, please join us. The ride is just starting.
What you’ll do
- Design, develop and iterate machine learning models for use in various parts of the EQL platform
- Identify gaps and opportunities where machine learning can further our product and customer experience, implement solutions in collaboration with our Dev and Product teams
- Run experiments and tests to understand the impact of ML in our products
- Work with the Data Engineering manager, Data Scientist and Product teams to propose, POC and productionise models
- Design, build and maintain our machine learning infrastructure, using tools such as Sagemaker, ML flow etc
- Identify, recommend and implement new approaches to infrastructure and tooling as you embed machine learning into our products
- Create a culture of ‘open source’ machine learning within the broader engineering team by evangelising ML and providing coaching and guidance to engineers
Who we look for
We focus on hiring values-aligned people because we believe the right person can learn everything to be successful in their role. We know that self-belief plays a big part in what you apply for, so we encourage everyone to apply even if they feel nervous about doing so. We don’t require degrees for any roles and we won’t pass judgement on career gaps or changes!
We believe you’ll succeed in this role if you have:
- A background in Machine Learning; you’ve deployed and scaled models in production
- Experience writing scalable machine learning models in Python
- Exposure to cloud environments such as AWS, Azure or GCP
- Familiarity with tools in the ML / Data Engineering stack such as; Scikit-learn, PyTorch, PySpark, Kinesis, Redshift or Sagemaker
- Understanding of data structures, data warehousing, data modeling, batch / stream processing
- Excellent communication skills and the ability to coach and educate others using various modes of communication
What we offer
Fairness is not just something for our fans and retailers - it’s part of who we are which is why:
- We provide equity in EQL - we want our team to have skin in the game and to be as invested as we are in EQL’s success. We want the people that will make EQL successful to share in that success
- We provide competitive compensation and evaluate the market to ensure that remains true
- We provide a flexible work environment because we understand that everyone works differently and want to support our team to be their best
- We provide generous time off above and beyond what we are required to because we know that well-rested people make better decisions and are more engaged - when you thrive we thrive
- When you want to collaborate in person with other humans, we have a workplace that welcomes the whole team including their furry friends.
At EQL, diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental to how we grow and operate our business. We’re building a diverse workforce that cultivates and supports all individuals. We believe a culture of equality creates a stronger work environment for all employees and that we are all accountable for encouraging and celebrating diverse voices. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, colour, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability status, marital status, caring responsibilities, pregnancy status, religion, political opinion, national or social origin"
