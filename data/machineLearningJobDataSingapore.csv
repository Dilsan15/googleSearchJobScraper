Collaborative machine learning is an appealing paradigm to build high-quality machine learning (ML) models by training on the data from many parties. However, concerns over trust and security have hindered the sharing of data between organizations. Much efforts have been focused on breaking the “data silos”, but the silos are inherently difficult to break at the data level, as personal or proprietary data are often involved.

We posit that the ML models can be more amenable for sharing as they are inherently more compact and self-contained with purpose-compiled knowledge from the data. Rather than requiring the learning collaborators to contribute their private data, this project will focus on enabling collaborative machine learning through allowing the collaborators to share heterogeneous black-box models, and to be appropriately incentivized based on their self-interests. Given that most current research are focused on the data level, this project will develop new... model-centric collaborative machine learning methods, as well as new notions for trustable model-centric sharing and effective model management techniques for real-world model-centric platforms.

This 4-year project will be led by Prof See-Kiong Ng and be conducted by the leading international and inter-disciplinary AI and data science researchers in the institute’s new Trusted Collaborative Machine Learning (Trusted CollabML) Lab. The CollabML Lab is a collaboration between the Institute of Data Science, the Department of Computer Science, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS), the School of Law at the Singapore Management University (SMU), as well as the Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The project team will design and develop a trustable, operational and legally-compliant model-centric sharing platform, validated with real-world data and applications provided by industry partners. Such a platform will be instrumental for powering a data-driven AI innovation ecosystem for a vibrant digital economy through trusted self-interest-driven sharing of learned machine intelligence.

The Role

The Research Assistant will be responsible for designing and implementing efficient and robust systems, and applications for algorithms and methodologies based on state-of-the-art research in machine learning and big data for collaborative machine learning.

Responsibilities:
• Design and write robust, readable, and reusable code components and applications to implement state-of-the-art research outcomes in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data;
• Perform data cleansing and processing for analysis of real-world datasets;
• Assists with the editing and preparation of manuscripts, reports and presentations.;
• Participate in presentations and demos for exhibiting work at appropriate events

Requirements:
• Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science with a focus in AI/Machine Learning/Big Data;
• Solid programming and application development skills with experience in Python/Perl/R. Mastery of programming languages such as C/C++/Java, and experience with Tensorflow would be a plus;
• Ability to read and understand methodologies in research papers;
• Fluent in English and good team-player

Note

At NUS, the health and safety of our staff and students is one of our utmost priorities and COVID-vaccination supports our commitment to ensure the safety of our community and to make NUS as safe and welcoming as possible. Many of our roles require significant amount of physical interactions with student / staff / public members.

About Vida

What are we trying to solve?

We have 7.5 billion people on Earth, of which over 1 billion cannot securely prove their identity right now.

Every year, 140 million babies are born, of which 40 million go unregistered.

Simply put, these people are deprived of social benefits, such as education and health, their civil rights to vote and travel; and are excluded from the economy because they cannot sign up for bank accounts, loans, welfare programs, etc. We believe this is unacceptable and needs to change.

At VIDA, We are creating a frictionless digital identity system. One that fulfills the needs and expectations of our times, and is available anywhere, for everyone.

Why are we solving this problem?

The United Nations (UN) and World Bank ID4D initiatives aim to provide everyone on the planet with a legal identity by 2030. This deadline is just 9 years away, we are expecting a digital identity to be a legal human right by then and we at VIDA want to be pioneers in leading this change.

Who are we?

We are a highly driven bunch of people to solve this problem for our own reasons. Whether it is to solve for misleading doctors, or because we didn’t get access to fair ration due to corruption - Our collective goal aligns.

Other things that we care about:
• Our mission is to enable trust, so what we do is pretty serious stuff – we work hard and we have audacious goals. We balance it through humor and making sure we have fun at work. We take our work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously.
• We are a startup so at times we will do things that are outside our scope. We do it to learn but we also do it because it takes a village.
• We believe feedback is a gift and should be given freely, constructively, and in a respectful manner.
• We are accountable to many stakeholders, but first and foremost, we are accountable to our mission and each other"

DESCARTES PROGRAM

The DesCartes programme is developing a hybrid AI, combining Learning, Knowledge and Reasoning, which has good properties (need for less resources and data, security, robustness, fairness, respect for privacy, ethics), and demonstrated on industrial applications of the smart city (digital energy, monitoring of structures, air traffic control).

The program brings together 80 permanent researchers (half from France, half from Singapore), with the support of large industrial groups (Thales SG, EDF SG, ESI group, CETIM Matcor, ARIA etc.).

The research will take place mainly in Singapore, at the premises of CNRS@CREATE, with a competitive salary and generous funding for missions.

Read more about the DesCartes program here.

DESCRIPTION

WP3 aims at

supporting the whole Descartes program in order to develop advanced optimization-based solutions in the context of hybrid AI. Any AI system... or machine learning algorithm ultimately involves a formulation with an objective or loss function to be minimized. The modelling of the problem as well as the chosen objective function optimization algorithm is crucial to the success of the overall AI task. This is all the more crucial in the context of hybrid AI, which seeks to integrate physics-inspired models with machine learning algorithms. We will address this problem from two complementary angles, namely optimization-based methods and machine learning-based methods.

The goal of this postdoctoral position is to solve robust polynomial optimization. The traditional setting uses deterministic uncertainty sets (i.e., neither distributional, nor data-driven). The postdoctoral fellow will consider data-driven distributionally robust optimization, will examine various distributional uncertainty sets, and will also rely on parametric polynomial optimization. Evolutionary algorithms will also be evaluated for solving these robust optimization problems.

EXPERIENCE & QUALIFICATIONS

Competences in some of the domains listed below will be highly considered:
• Computer Science
• Optimization
• Machine Learning.

Keywords:
• Optimal power flow
• Optimization (convex, non convex)
• Deep learning
• Programming (python or Julia or Matlab)
