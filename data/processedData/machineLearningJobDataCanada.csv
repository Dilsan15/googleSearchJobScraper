The projects that this role will be involved in will have a data-centric focus.Contribute to projects related to BI and data visualization, integrated data and analytics platform/enterprise data lake, data and information sharing web portals, advanced analytics (AA), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML).Background:The Government of Alberta (GoA) provides a number of services to Albertans. Every ministry provides a unique set of services. In doing so, large amounts of data are generated on a daily basis. GoA is in a position to use this data for the social good of its citizens by transforming the way it organizes itself, run its processes and make decisions.The growing... expectation of citizens is just one of the challenges facing governments today. Rapid urbanization, an aging population and complex socio-economic problems are putting public services under strain. With low economic growth that resulted in lower budgets, GoA need to find solutions that are both efficient and sustainable.Globally, the private sector uses AA/AI/ML technologies to autombubuate tasks, make better decisions and improve customer experience. GoA recognizes the potential of these technologies to transform the way they organize themselves and run its processes. By use of such technologies, GoA can anticipate the expectations of citizens, create new services, and take appropriate action to provide services to enhance and secure their lives. Being a public body, there is a distinction in how use of such technologies would provide additional benefits to the GoA, as compared to the private sector.GoA already has self-serve data visualization tools in place (e.g. SAS Visual Analytics, MS Power BI). Integrated data and analytics platform (data lake - Cloudera Data Platform) is in the later stages of implementation in the GoA. AI/ML tools are mainly in the conceptual or planning phase in GoA, although there may already be small pockets of implementation.Job Description:Responsible for taking business requirements and translating them into technical requirements and solutions.• Create project documents and associated planning documents.• Create stakeholder analyses.• Lead consultations and facilitate stakeholder meetings.• Create business requirements, functional specifications and technical requirements.• Create new business and technical processes and complete business process reviews/re-engineering for existing processes.• Facilitate business process improvement sessions.• Assist in the development of new IT services.• Schedule, organize and lead project status meetings and other meetings as required.• Provide support by bridging communication between vendors, client ministries, and corporate technical and business teams.• Escalate unresolved issues/risks, options and recommendations.• Responsible for business architecture design, software system specifications design, and database modelling.• Participate iterative development using model-based processes .• Perform project management, business and technical analysis and systems design in delivering complex software solutions spanning n-tier development environments.• Produce project artifices with XML; UML and/or other web-services technologies.• Prepare, update and manage documents defining the business requirements, software requirements, functional design, and project plans and schedules reflecting achievable deliverables for the applications.• Prepare regular project status reports indicating project deliverables, possible risk and issues, time-lines and anticipated effort.• Ensure appropriate project communication occurs to all parties involved during all phases of the project.• Identify required user training.• Additional responsibilities as required by the Project Manager for a Business Analyst or Lead Technical Analyst roleQualificationsCreate project documents and associated planning documents.• Create stakeholder analyses.• Lead consultations and facilitate stakeholder meetings.• Create business requirements, functional specifications and technical requirements.• Create new business and technical processes and complete business process reviews/re-engineering for existing processes.• Facilitate business process improvement sessions.Additional InformationAll your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines"
