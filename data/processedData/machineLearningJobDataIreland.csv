Specialising in both electronics and photonics  materials, devices, circuits and systems  we are globally leading in our core research areas of bio-photonics, bioelectronics, biomedical devices and systems. As the national institute for photonics and micro/nanoelectronics and a research flagship of UCC, the institute employs 600 researchers, engineers and support staff, including 120 full-time graduate students. Tyndall is the lead institute for the Irish Photonics Integration Centre (IPIC) and European Space Agency (ESA) Space Solutions Centre Ireland and hosts industry-aligned research centres; Microelectronic Circuits Centre Ireland (MCCI); International Energy Research Centre (IERC); and... the Centre for Future Networks and Communications (CONNECT).Reporting to Prof. Padraig Cantillon-Murphy, this position involves the development of new algorithms including machine learning approaches for intelligent visualisation of tool position within magnetic tracking. The student will be based at the Tyndall National Institute with a students appointment in the School of Engineering, University College Cork.Magnetic Tracking is a technology which enables the use of navigated instruments in image-guided interventions such as surgery without the use of x-rays. Magnetic tracking involves the use of frequency-modulated magnetic fields in the volume of interest. These fields are detected by tiny sensors (currently under development at MCCI) embedded within surgical tools and instruments. This approach works well in the absence of metal distortion of the magnetic field from other large medical equipment such as CT imaging machines.The aim of this project is to develop new algorithms which provide intelligent visualisation of the tracked tool position. To date, the algorithm to determine the tracked tool position is determined by a non-linear least-squares regression approach without any additional input. This project will combine a priori tool position, supplementary sensor inputs and possibly machine learning approaches to determine an intelligent tool position. This work will take place in Python but Matlab and C may also be used, particularly for edge-based computing. Finally, the project will look to provide a visualisation of the tool position in the virtual 3D Slicer environment. 3D Slicer is an open-source visualisation platform for image-guided surgery (https://www.slicer.org/) which is in C and Python.ResponsibilitiesThe candidate is expected to be creative, self-motivated, and should help create an efficiently and friendly atmosphere within the research team at UCC and Tyndall.• Propose innovative approaches for intelligent visualisation of tool position in magnetic tracking.• With guidance, implement visualisation of the optimised tool position in the 3D Slicer environment. This involves Python-based implementation using real and simulated tracking data, as well as interfacing with the system-level hardware already available in the research group.• Engage in the dissemination of the results of the research, as directed by and with the support of senior Tyndall and UCC research staff.Essential Criteria:• The minimum academic qualification is a first or upper second class honours degree (or an equivalent international degree) in electrical engineering, industrial physics, electronic engineering, physics or related relevant discipline.• The successful candidate will be highly analytical with good interpersonal and organisational skills.Desirable Criteria• Knowledge of Python, Matlab, Mathematica, and LaTeX.• Good mathematical ability and knowledge of signal processing.• Knowledge of interface between hardware and software systems.• The successful candidate will be highly innovative with a strong desire to create world-beating solutions in the area of magnetic tracking for image-guided surgery.An annual student stipend of 18,500 applies for this successful candidate for this position. Yearly University academic fees will paid by the Tyndall National Institute.For any informal queries, please contact Prof. Padraig Cantillon-Murphy at P.CantillonMurphyucc.ie"
