We play an instrumental role in Luxembourg by fueling innovation through research partnerships with industry, boosting R&D investments leading to economic growth, and attracting highly qualified talent.Manufacturing companies in the Industry 4.0 era are increasingly looking for implementing Predictive Maintenance (PdM) to predict failures, classify faults, and optimize maintenance tasks. Artificial Intelligence (AI), and particularly Machine Learning (ML) techniques are applied to build such prediction, classification and optimization models. Although these models yield high performance in static scenarios, their performance becomes questionable during operational use due to possible model drifts(a.k.a, concept and data drifts), which occur when changes happen within the statistical properties of the target class labels or within the independent features (e.g... due to perturbations resulting from a change in hardware, a defective sensor, a network malfunction, wireless interferences, etc.). Overall, it is not an easy task to deploy and maintain ML algorithms in real-life environments; some studies having evidenced that putting a model from a research environment into production  where it eventually starts adding business value  takes from 8 to 90 days on average, and what is worse, up to 75% of ML projects never go beyond the experimental phase. To avoid this, reduce deployment and maintenance efforts, and facilitate collaboration between data science teams and IT professionals, an increasing interest for automated ML pipelines (aka AutoML pipeline) is observed. The objective of this Post-doc is to help the Cebi company, which is a worldwide manufacturer of electromechanical components for the automotive industry, household appliances and industrial applications, to design and set up such an AutoML pipeline. Within this context, the candidate must commit to support the industrial partnership on a daily/weekly basis, which implies supporting the PhD students who are working under this partnership with Cebi: the first PhD student focusing on the prediction of failures/faults using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)-like approaches; the second student focusing on developing innovative maintenance scheduling policies using Reinforcement Learning. Your role will be to contribute in the supervision of these two PhD students, which will lay the groundwork towards the design of the AutoML pipeline.
