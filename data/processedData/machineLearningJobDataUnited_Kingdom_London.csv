Currently we produce 2.1 billion tons of solid waste per year. Data collection of the waste we produce is non-existent, meaning no systematic transparency and no accountability. It means that recycling targets are not upheld, dumping of waste into our oceans remains nobody's responsibility, recyclables get sent to landfill or incineration, and producers get away with sub-standard packaging. Thus, recycling rates stubbornly remain at 10% and, unless we change, by 2040 the plastic stock in the ocean will have quadrupled - a problem that already costs society $1.5 trillion each year. Our mission is to increase transparency and automation in waste management to accelerate the circular economy. Currently, our camera system and AI software are deployed in recycling plants and waste facilities around the world to measure material flows and provide waste analytics. We have compiled a team of experts to deploy our technology and were looking to expand our team.

We hire the brightest minds in the world to tackle some of the biggest questions in finance. We pair this expertise with machine learning, big data, and some of the most advanced technology available to predict movements in financial markets. The role Machine Learning is an integral part of G-Researchs work. We use applied ML techniques to develop successful investment management strategies; it is one of the core drivers of our overall performance and success. ML has long been a key tool at G-Research and we count among our number a range of ICML and NeurIPS published researchers. Joining our leading ML team, you will have huge amounts of (clean) data and massive compute at your fingertips, with which you will predict the future of financial markets. Because this is a very mature prediction problem, finding the 1% of difference, working at the very cutting edge of developments, is the place where... success happens. You will, in effect, be incentivised to explore the state-of-the-art. While we start with the standard ML toolkit, to make a model work our researchers really need to understand whats going on, not just throw an out-of-the-box solution at a dataset. This involves applying machine learning methods drawn from diverse areas such as neural networks, reinforcement learning, deep learning, non-convex optimisation, Bayesian non-parametrics, NLP and approximate inference. Unlike pure problems, our researchers get near-instantaneous feedback on their work in the form of absolute numbers: success is highly measurable and has direct impact on the business. As a team, we read the latest publications in the field and discuss them within the firms vibrant research community and attend the leading conferences worldwide (e.g. NeurIPS, ICML, ACL etc.). In this research role you will be able to develop and test your ideas with real-world data in an environment that resembles academia. Who are we looking for The ideal candidate will at a minimum have experience in the following areas:  Either a post-graduate degree in machine learning or a related discipline, or commercial experience developing novel machine learning algorithms. We will also consider exceptional candidates with a proven record of success in online data science competitions (e.g. Kaggle).  Experience in one or more of deep learning, reinforcement learning, non-convex optimisation, Bayesian non-parametrics, NLP or approximate inference.  Excellent reasoning skills and mathematical ability are crucial: off the shelf methods dont always work on our data so you will need to understand how to develop your own models.  Strong programming skills and experience working with Python, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks is desirable. Experience with object oriented programming would be beneficial.  Publications at top conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR etc. is highly desirable. Why should you apply  Highly competitive compensation plus annual discretionary bonus  Lunch provided (via Just Eat for Business) and dedicated barista bar  30 days annual leave  9% company pension contributions  Informal dress code and excellent work/life balance  Comprehensive healthcare and life assurance  Cycle-to-work scheme  Monthly company events G-Research is committed to cultivating and preserving an inclusive work environment.
