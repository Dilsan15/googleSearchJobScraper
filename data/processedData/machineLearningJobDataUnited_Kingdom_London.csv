Technologies:- PyTorch - Tensor Flow - AWS - Git - Terraform More:Hypermile is on a mission to improve trucking efficiency, sustainability and safety by developing an AI driver assistance system . Today, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for 1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions.In addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes.With this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. Our product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel:anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. The company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5Mpre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving l 5) and others.

Our mission is to develop Machine Learning products and solutions that can enable rapid decarbonisation of these industries. Initially this will involve improving and optimising the current manufacturing process but in the long term we aim to rethink and redesign these manufacturing systems for net-zero and accelerate the development of new climate-friendly materials and processes.About this roleAs an experienced engineer in our Machine Learning team, you will lead the improvement of our... recommendation engine by improving our models and developing better optimisation systems. You will mainly work with time-series physical / chemical data, focusing on building and evaluating deep learning models in these contexts.

You generally have a track record of excellent engineering skills across multiple domains.• Have strong experience with a variety of modern ML tooling and frameworks, including at least one of PyTorch, JAX, or Tensorflow.• Have experience in leading the development of machine learning-based products, especially around recommendation systems for time-series data.• Have experience (and/or strong interest) in building models that understand and reason about complex physical and chemical processes.• Have a solid understanding of Machine Learning, from foundations to modern approaches, as well as the state of the field and ecosystem.• Enjoy developing tools across the full ML life cycle for ML-centric products.• Enjoy running experiments in a rigorous way, and developing better ways to do so.• Are familiar with modern compute infrastructure stacks such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Cloudflare, etc.• Have experience taking a leading role in the growth of your team.• Are strongly interested in making a positive impact towards quickly mitigating climate change.Note that if you dont meet all of these qualifications, you should still consider applying. We are building a diverse company with people coming from all sorts of backgrounds and with different skill sets.About usWe dont draw a specific line between engineering and research teams. We all share the same tech stack, knowledge, tools, and work.

In addition, we have a great influence on the overall... customer experience and it's our duty to keep them safe. Most of the work we do results in directly measurable customer or company benefit which is incredibly satisfying.Our Machine Learning Scientists don't have a permanent assignment to a problem space and might rotate into different financial crime areas after some time. The major problem spaces that we are working in are: fraud prevention, transaction monitoring for different types of suspicious activity, customer risk assessment and operational tooling to name the biggest ones.

We use BigQuery and Jupyter Notebooks to analyse data and design machine learning models for offline evaluation. For example, we are investigating machine learning powered assistants for our customer operations team, classifiers to detect financial fraud or to assess customer risk at signup.• Launch. We build Python micro services and cron jobs to put promising machine learning models into production. We are actively working on automating as much of this step as possible: our goal is for any data scientist or ML engineer to be able to deploy a promising new model to production in less than a day.• Iterate.
