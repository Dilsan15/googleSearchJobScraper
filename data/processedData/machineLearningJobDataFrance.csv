Its unique technology thoroughly examines the structure of complex software systems, with MRI-like precision. It delivers accurate, actionable, and automated views of software architecture, critical flaws, quality grades, sizing metrics, open-source usage, and cloud readiness levels. Hundreds of companies rely on CAST for greater objectivity in crucial business decisions, faster application modernization for Cloud, raising the quality and security of their custom software.Founded more than 25 years ago and backed by nearly $200 million in R&D, CASTs rapid analysis technology and its advanced MRI for Software drive IT transformation and enable automation at the worlds largest systems... integrators, hundreds of Global 2000 enterprises, and government agencies, in North America, Europe, India and in China.CAST provides two sets of products of different technologies, implementation models, and usage:CAST Highlight is a SaaS product capable of performing rapid application portfolio analysis. It analyzes source code of applications to measure their cloud readiness, to analyze their composition, resiliency, and technical debt.CAST Imaging on the other hand is an on-premises product that can run for reverse-engineers all database structures, code components, and interdependencies in custom-built applications. It provides interactive and accurate architecture blueprints, data-call graphs, and end-to-end transaction flows.ContextThe use of open-source libraries and frameworks leads to more and more dependencies on open-source components, this eventually creates an invisible layer of code that is difficult to trace permanently.From a list of predefined roles of open-source components, we need to classify open-source components at package level but also at method level.This classification is needed by CAST imaging to better classify internal code and to see which part does what. For example, access to databases or a call to an authentication API or a call to a web service, or a call to a cloud service.Proposed workThe objective of the internship is to train models in order to determine the role of an open-source component at component level, class level and method level.We already have tested some ML approaches by analyzing source code of open-source components from GitHub.The main objective of the project will therefore be:• Build a set of GitHub projects having a given role• Create different models per role using source code available under Github• Try another approach using online documentation of given component• Set up an unsupervised functional classification method for these OS modulesTeamIn CAST, The R&D team is more than 100 people divided between France and India. Organized by many teams and all coordinated by the R&D director. The majority of team leader are based in our French headquarter in Meudon.For this internship, the intern will essentially work with the R&D director, R&D architect and product managers managing Analyzers and Imaging team.Working with Imaging, CAST R&D team means being an important part of a highly talented, fast-paced, multicultural, and Agile team based in Paris (France) and Bangalore (India).The team builds architecture, visualization using sophisticated source code analysis platform leveraging parsing, control flow, data flow, and other mechanisms to fully understand the inner structure of the complex IT Systems developed and used by Fortune 500 companies.Required skills• Bachelor/Masters degree studies in apprenticeship in Computer Science, Databases Management, Machine Learning and/or related technical field.• Good collaborative and networking skills, excellent written and oral communication in English• Strong analytical skills• Strong background in statisticsMain tech (not necessarily all required): Python, Scikit-Learn, GitWhen: FlexibleWhere: Position is located at CASTs France office at Meudon, le-de-France: 3 Rue Marcel Allgot, 92190  MeudonWhat we offer youLunch - Each employee benefits from a Swile card and access to FoodChriRemote - the possibility of remote work up to 3 days a week.An exceptional working environment - we are well settled in a former mansion ideally located in Meudon with a beautiful garden (10 min by train from Montparnasse).Feedback-Friendly Culture - In CAST we believe in effective feedback, we have been since day one normalizing feedback by incorporating it in our routine and creating safe space for employees to debate about what is and isnt working.Career prospects - In addition to our internal mobility policy that encourages employees to move between teams and subsidiaries.

Let's go for an immersionVisit the profileMeet... Louis, Software EngineerMeet Xavier, CEOMeet Hajar, Online Business ManagerJob descriptionAs a Machine Learning research intern at Joko, you will work on the automatic analysis of web pages, which is central for many core features of the smart web browser (and of the smart browser extensions) that we are currently building. For instance, your work will be key to delivering functionalities such as price tracking, product comparison, or universal one-click purchase on any e-commerce website, independently of specific website designs. Your work will also lay down the foundations of a radically new type of web browser, able to recognize and transform elements in real time on any website, in order to offer a unified and smooth shopping experience to our users.You will typically work on the following problems:Webpage classification: to detect if a webpage is a checkout page, a basket page, a product page for instance.Webpage element classification: typically to identify web page elements such as prices, product images, user reviews, product descriptions, product features, credit card fields, shipping details forms, etc.Automatization of user journeys: for instance, to automatically complete a checkout flow on behalf of the user.Solving these problems requires digging deep into how webpages are transformed and rendered by web browsers, and find the right level of abstraction for the algorithms. In particular, you will work on the DOM structure (Document Object Model), which is a tree data structure that plays a central role in the functioning of web browsers. As the DOM is a tree, it can typically be leveraged through graph neural networks. But as it also contains very rich text and image data, these graph algorithms can be combined with NLP and Computer Vision algorithms to achieve maximum performance. You will also work on real-time inference and the embedding of your algorithms on devices with limited CPU and memory.The literature on these subjects is still in its infancy, and exploration will represent an important part of the internship, through experiments, literature reviews, and theoretical developments. You will have full ownership of your projects, and the liberty to orient the research direction of your internship based on your results and what you consider promising amongst directions we determined.You will work closely with the engineering team that will be here to help you integrate coding best practices into your research, and to give you an insider look into modern software development. You will also have the possibility to integrate some of the algorithms you designed into our product, and monitor their impacts on hundreds of thousands of users.Your responsibilities:Research: You will work on all steps of the research process  you will formalize the objectives of your work, conduct literature reviews to have a deep understanding of the problems, design new algorithms, analyze them both theoretically and experimentally, and collect and transform relevant data for your experiments.Exploration & ownership: You will participate in orienting the internship towards research directions you deem valuable to our users.Implementation, deployment & monitoring in production: Helped by the engineering team, you will be responsible for integrating into our product the most scalable and robust algorithms you will have worked on. Finally, you will monitor their impact on our users.Processes: You will help improve our R&D tools, processes, and organization.Preferred experienceProblem solver: You have strong analytical skills, you are creative, and you love solving complex problems.Fast learner: You are comfortable in any technical environment and are able to quickly learn new technologies and new practices.Programming skills: You have experience with writing code and are willing to improve on it. You have experience with Python and Python Machine Learning frameworks.Attention to details: You know that the devil is in the details, and you have talent for spotting flaws when they exist.Tech savvy: You are constantly looking at emerging technologies and you keep a close eye on the latest trends in the domain.Efficiency: You are fond of productivity tools and able to deliver on time on projects with many stakeholders.Mindset: You have an entrepreneurial mindset, you like challenges, you welcome feedback and you are willing to get better every day to reach excellence.Communication: You have strong written and verbal communication skills, and you are able to explain something complex with simple words.Languages: You are fluent in English both written and spoken, as we are expanding internationally soon. Mastering French is not required.Education: You are a graduate student in a Machine Learning master.Nice to have:You have experience with research, from past internships or projectsYou have knowledge in web automation and/or in web browser development"

We are working on the creation of autonomous agents capable of high-level visual reasoning and solving tasks requiring navigation in an unknown environment, such as a building, an apartment. Our current methodology addresses this problem in an ""Active Neural SLAM"" mode, i.e. no pre-existing maps or representations are required, the agents builds maps on the fly. These maps are metric and contain different content: occupancy, semantics, and latent representations, which are learned from different signals like RL, IL, SSL etc. These maps are used by different motion planners, symbolic and learned.While the advantage of this solution is the flexibility and speed with which it can be deployed (no 3D scans, adaptation or fine-tuning are required), it has also several drawbacks. Most importantly, existing 3D scans (if available... contain valuable information, which can significantly improve navigation performance and robustness of the algorithms. Secondly, the meta-data available with these maps integrates well with the downstream application and user interface, as they can make it easier for humans to provide navigation goals.The purpose of this internship is to adapt our models to allow an agent to also use existing maps from different origins: 3D scans / SfM, or explorative rollouts from an agent prior to the main episodes (Lidar scans). They can be of various forms, including 3D meshes, 3D point clouds, 2D occupancy grids, or latent point clouds (R2D2 keypoints). The goal is to dynamically align these static representations with the ones which are dynamically estimated by the robot and to exploit them for navigation. The candidate will carry out research and development activities to achieve important milestones toward this goal:• Understanding the existing navigation methodology developed at NAVER LABS Europe• Pre-processing of (already available) maps and scans• Development of algorithms, which dynamically align these data with the dynamic maps collected and estimated by the agent itself• Exploiting the combined data in a hybrid navigation algorithmThe successful candidate should be enrolled in a graduate program, at the Master or PhD level.Supervisors: Christian Wolf"

To date, the detection approach of the yellows is to collectively explore the vineyard on foot every year to identify affected vines and to perform biomolecular tests by approved laboratories. As the survey is not precise... nor optimal enough for a large-scale monitoring, the development and integration of detection solutions based on imagery appear necessary.We conducted several acquisition campaigns between 2019 and 2022 under controlled and in situ conditions. New CNN-based hierarchical architectures developed by our lab have proven to be efficient on separate data sets composed of multispectral images. But the generalization capabilities of these models are not sufficient to compensate for the variability induced by endogenous and exogenous factors. The objective is to propose new detection strategies for grapevine yellows that are more robust to this variability. Several tracks could be explored, including, but not limited to:•Fusion of multispectral images through vegetation indices to be defined and used within adapted Deep Learning architectures•Fusion of features extracted with heterogeneous Deep Learning models from multispectral images•Identification of an optimal subset of multispectral images and development of reinforcement or continuous learning approachesIt might also be interesting to design semi-supervised approaches to take advantage of the possibility of acquiring many unlabeled images during new acquisition campaigns to which the Postdoc will be associated.LocationThe PostDoc will be based at the CReSTIC lab of the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne on the Moulin de la Housse campus in Reims. Within the framework of the project, he/she may be required to intervene to the project partners, the Comit de Champagne in Epernay or Segula Technologies in Reims downtown.Profil • Self-motivated scientist seeking to pursue a scientific career, holding a Ph.D. or in the process of completing it, in a relevant field of machine/deep learning or other relevant fields• Excellent knowledge and skills in AI learning, machine learning and data science with hand-on skill and experience• Excellent experience, knowledge, and skills in programming languages, especially Python (environment Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.)• Deep understand of digital image processing; prior experience in working with image analysis projects (industrial or academic) will be a plus• Independent and passionate about data science projects, however good team player, able to undertake research projects together with other team members• Excellent scientific/technical writing skills and communication capability; ability to present research achievements at internal/external seminars, conferences and journals"

In the field of oncology, these data are now of great value for diagnosing cancers, identifying their molecular subtypes and guiding the therapeutic decision. Artificial intelligence methods, and in particular those based on Deep Learning, have recently enabled great advances in the analysis of this data. The usual implementation of these methods is done from large data sets located on a centralized storage space connected to high-performance computing nodes. However, the transfer of these large volumes of sensitive patient data, produced in hospitals, in centralized spaces, outside of hospitals, is associated with several difficulties. Indeed, the large volume of thisdata as well as the new General Data Protection Regulation, established at European level to protect and... control the use of this sensitive patient data, pose challenges related to data security and energy consumption. To try to overcome these difficulties, distributed (or federated) deep learning strategies have been developed in recent years. They make it possible to keep sensitive patient data in their places of production and to transfer in a centralized space only the parameters which are used to train the predictive models. The performance of this distributed strategy has so far been demonstrated on simulated data, on use cases conventionally used to test methods (e.g. MNIST data), but not on histological imaging or genomic patient data.Objective : This project aims to study the performance of Deep Learning models trained in distributed (federated) mode compared to that obtained by these same models trained in centralized mode. This work will be carried out in collaboration with researchers from the European KATY project on personalized medicine (https://katy-).Host laboratory: The engineer will be hosted in the ""Genetics and Chemogenomics"" team of the Interdisciplinary Research Institute of Grenoble (IRIG) of the CEA Grenoble. He/she will be co-supervised by Christophe Battail (IRIG, CEA Grenoble), expert in computational analysis and modeling of genomic data, and by Stphane Gazut (DM2I/LIST, CEA Saclay), expert in Deep Learning methods. He/she will evolve in a multidisciplinary research environment composed of AI-experts, bioinformaticians and biologists. The engineer will also interact with developers and researchers from the European KATY project.Profil du candidatCandidate profile:Technical skills: Big Data architecture (Hadoop), AI/ML/DL algorithms, unix command line and Python programming. Professional aptitude: curiosity and desire to improve their scientific and technological skills, rigor and organization, and ability to work in a team and interact with other students, engineers and researchers.Workplan : The engineer will work on two use cases whose data is already available and collected. In the first use case, he/she will start from a Deep Learning model already developed, and trained in centralized mode, to segment histological images of cancers in order to locate and quantify different cell populations of interest. He/she will implement a distributed (federated) version of this Deep learning model and evaluate its performance against the one trained in centralized mode. In the second use case, the engineer will work from patient transcriptomic data associated with clinical metadata. He/she will contribute to the development of a Deep learning model to predict the response of patients to drug treatments based on the genetic characteristics of their cancers. He/she will then compare the performance of this algorithm when trained in centralized or distributed mode.In line with the CEA's commitment to the integration of people with disabilities, this application is open to all.For all inquiries about the position, please contact Christphe Battail -To apply, please send a CV and a letter of motivation and a reference letter"
