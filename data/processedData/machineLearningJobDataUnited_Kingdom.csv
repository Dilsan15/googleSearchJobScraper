Concrete is the most widely used construction material, its fabrication consumes a large number of natural resources (fine and coarse aggregates from sand and gravel), and the associated cement production contributes around 8% of CO2 emission. More than 4 billion tonnes of aggregate will be needed to meet UKs construction demands between 2022 and 2035, according to the mineral product association (MPA). Solutions for more sustainable concrete have become imperative, among which replacing natural aggregates with recycled aggregates (RA) from construction and demolition wastes is encouraged. This can reduce prudent use of natural resources, maximise use of recycled construction waste along with potential for cost savings.The... project targets a paradigm shift in using recycled aggregates in structures. Innovative structural solutions will be developed incorporating a high volume of recycled aggregates. In the project, advanced machine learning methods and techniques will be employed and adapted for modelling constitutive behaviour of confined concrete incorporating recycled aggregates. Validation for the applicability of confined concrete material will be made against their performance in concrete-steel composite structures.This project would suit a graduate with good knowledge in Structural Engineering and the motivation and interests in sustainability of infrastructures and the solutions for net-zero. The research will be supported by the facilities at Center of structural engineering and informatics at University of Nottingham and School of Engineering at University of Birmingham.Entry requirements:Applicants should have, or expect to obtain, a 1st class or 2.1 honours degree in Civil Engineering. Students with experience in Matlab/Python are encouraged to apply. We require an enthusiastic graduate with a 1st class degree in engineering, computer science, maths, or a relevant discipline, at integrated Masters level or with a relevant MSc (in exceptional circumstances a 2:1 degree can be considered).Due to funding restrictions this position is only available for UK candidates.However, we welcome international candidates, funding is only available for exceptional students.How to apply:Applications are invited to work on a double PhD between the Universities of Nottingham and Birmingham, on application of AI for sustainable construction.

In the short time since the group was established, greats success - both technically and commercially - has been achieved.As a result of these successes, SRG is seeking to grow, allowing the group to tackle more challenges and deliver further successes.What makes... SRG differentSRG is an expert group, made of a team of people with broad skills, expertise and experience. The team includes post-doctorate researchers, experienced data scientists and engineers with customer knowledge, security research and machine learning expertise.SRGs culture sets it apart from many other teams. It is vital to how the group operates and to its success.SRG values creating and sharing tangible results over creating overly detailed plans and excessive PowerPoint presentations. The team deliver a mix of internally funded research and customer funded projects.SRG work on a cloud first basis - AWS, Atlassian, GitHub, Slack are main productivity tools.SRG is collaborative, supportive and independent. Above all, every member of the group strives to delight and impress our stakeholders, taking great pride in their work.Data Science & Machine Learning Research Engineer (G09)Essential Behaviours & AttitudeDelivery.Hands-on experience designing, creating, building and operating complex software systems.
