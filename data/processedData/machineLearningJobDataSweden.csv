Investment decisions are still being made out of pdfs and shark tank-like processes rather than utilising the forecasting methods found at companies like Spotify or Google. This makes capital allocation riddled with bias and very ripe for disruption.At ArK were convinced that by putting data and tech at the heart of finance we can impact how money flows and, in turn, create a more democratised and unbiased economy.Today we offer founders access to our machine learning platform AIM. Through connecting their raw data we can fully understand what theyve built without any bias; connecting what has been achieved historically into a simulated 5-year future. This prediction is the foundation for the transformational loans that we are able to issue, and a tool that founders get to keep for business optimisation.AiM is using big data and machine learning to... analyse and predict companies current and future performance, to be used as a foundation for our frontier credit decision making. All in all, we thrive in the win-win data modelling where insights are valuable both for ArK as a lender, but also for our customer as a growth company.

Variations of encoder- based models pre- trained for self- supervised tasks like masked input modeling have been applied successfully for text (), image (), sound () and tabular (, ) data domains. This pre- training stage builds a robust understanding of how features relate to each other without needing labeling and allows for higher performance on downstream tasks. The primary objective of this project is to investigate how to leverage self- supervised transformer- based models to make more use of the tabular data King already has available. This could lower the barrier to entry for new machine learning applications, lower re- training costs and possibly increase performance in already established downstream tasks.

Our main focus is on smart cities and self-driving vehicles. The Company is based in Stockholm, Sweden, but we work with clients all over the world. Our team now consists of 50 hard-working and friendly people, all working in our bright and spacious facilities by Medborgarplatsen in the heart of Sdermalm, Stockholm. We are constantly expanding due to the increasing demand for high-quality technologies in 3D perception and mapping. And thats where you come in!Master Thesis at UnivrsesRight now, we offer Master students the opportunity to be an integral part of the team while working on their Thesis. You will be working in a fun, stimulating and highly professional work environment together with our... awesome team. This is truly a unique chance to work with some of the best scientists and engineers in Computer Vision and Robotics in the world.The projects: Multi-modal learning meets Domain AdaptationCross-city domain shift is the cause of a 25-30% accuracy drop in normal Deep Learning predictors. Changes in weather and lighting conditions might even result in more disruptive effects. The cause of this disruption lies in a gap between the training and deployment domain, we refer to this concept as domain shift. Therefore, to provide a robust and accurate output, the predictor would need to be trained on every possible deployment condition, e.g. multiple cities, districts, seasons, kinds of weather, cameras pose and camera intrinsics. This vastly reduces AI solutions' scalability in terms of costs and deployment time. Self-supervised learning Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods proved to be very effective in mitigating (or even solving) these shortcomings. Univrses has been active for several years in the research of UDA methods in Vision Deep Learning, in the form of MSc theses, internal investigations and published conference papers.Recently, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) achieved astonishing results, managing to learn from unstructured and unlabelled data with performances competitive to fully supervised methods. Such sharp improvements are shaking the foundations of Deep Learning as we know it.Several deep learning long-sought goals now seem withins arm's reach, e.g. open set classification and adaptation, continuously adaptive systems, and multimodal learning with scarce annotations. With the advent of CLIP and other SSL and Online Adaption techniques, were seeing the dawn of a new Deep Learning era, where were moving away from fixed semantics, fixed datasets and fixed objectives.GoalsThe goal of this project is to leverage the recent advancement in SSL and multimodal learning to find new ways to tackle domain adaptation.

The positions are situated within the research project Observatory of Poverty, situated in the AI and Global Development Lab (you will find more information about the Lab at www.global-lab.ai), funded by the Swedish Research Council (SRC). The Lab furthers the use of AI for Social Good for the sustainable development goals.Project descriptionAbout 900 million peopleone-third in Africalive in extreme poverty. Operating on the assumption that life in impoverished communities is fundamentally so different that it can trap people in cycles of deprivation (poverty traps), major development agencies have deployed a stream of development projects to break these cycles (poverty targeting). However, scholars are currently unable to answer questions such as in what capacity do poverty traps exist; to what extent do these... interventions release communities from such trapsas they are held back by a data challenges. This challenge is that there is a lack of geo-temporal poverty data, and thus, one of the goals of the Observatory of Poverty project is to develop new methods to produce such data. Thus, this is the main challenge that the postdoc is expected to contribute to.1.To train learning algorithms to estimate poverty from satellite images, of African communities over time and space, quarterly, from 1984 to 2020.2.To contribute to creating a statistical packageObservatoryOfPovertythat enables us, and other scholars, to produce poverty estimates for policy evaluation.Another goal of the Observatory of Poverty is to use our poverty estimates to identify to what extent African communities are trapped in poverty and explain how competing aid and development interventions alter these communities prospects to free themselves from deprivation. This goal is about causal inference. Thus, a secondary goal of the postdoc position is to facilitate the methodological development for causal inference for the project.In other words, we are searching for a candidate that is interested in either poverty estimation from satellite images or the causal inference part of the project, or both. Your interest should be clearly stated in your application and linked to your track-record.The candidate for the postdoc position will join the AI and Global Development Lab and is expected to produce research that contributes to the listed objectives or related spin-off objectives (e.g., based on the candidates research interest).
