It provides a non-invasive and non-destructive method for examining a wide range of samples, for example, to find out the composition of SARS-CoV-2 at an atomic level. The outcome of such NMR measurements is often a spectrum, which precisely describes the content of the examined sample. Deep learning methods are currently utilized to process the spectrum and extract features. However, the spectra are often of high dimensions, and thus, the computational demands for processing them are high. Luckily, spectra contain unimportant information like noise, and a small set of variables can often describe the critical features. Your task: You will use deep learning techniques to compress spectra into a set of descriptive... features that are enough to reconstruct the spectrum from them. Specifically, autoencoders (or encoder-decoder networks) are a promising approach: The encoder compresses the input to a small latent representation, and the decoder can reconstruct the input given this latent space. Your task includes finding the most suitable autoencoder structure (e.g. VAE) to compress NMR spectra, and to implement a functioning pipeline in pytorch (or similar).You will be part of Prof. Korvinks research group where you can get support from members with expertise in NMR theory, methodology, hardware, and simulation.This research center is part of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers.

Our promise to our associates is rock-solid: we grow together, we enjoy our work, and we inspire each other. Join in and feel the difference.The Robert Bosch GmbH is looking forward to your application!Job DescriptionDeep learning is increasingly used for addressing perception problems such as, e.g., object detection, object tracking, or panoptic segmentation, in domains such as driver assistance/automated driving, robotics, or video surveillance. Two of the major challenges faced when deploying deep learning models under these conditions are:• Due to real-time or privacy constraints, the deep learning model needs to run on the edge device. Resources consumption on edge devices must be relatively little, which puts hard or soft limits on quantities such as, e.g., latency and energy consumption.• After deployment on the edge... device, the model will oftentimes face data unlike the typical data covered in its training data - there will be (continuous and/or sudden) domain shift and rare corner cases.While each of these two challenges has been studied extensively in isolation, there is relatively little work that addresses both challenges at the same time. In contrast there is growing evidence that resource efficiency and robustness are at odds with each other: robustness to domain shift benefits largely from scaling models in terms of capacity and training data, while resource constraints prohibit exactly this scaling.The goal of this thesis is to devise novel approaches for increasing robustness to domain shift under resource constraints. Possible directions for this are dynamic routing in neural networks, continual learning/test-time adaptation, or novel architectural building blocks for neural networks.The PhD candidate will have the possibility to explore other directions that fall into the general framework of robust resource-constrained perception.PhD candidates in our department will enjoy top quality inspiring research in an enthusiastic international environment of researchers in Bosch's Corporate Research. Networking with other PhD candidates, industrial professionals from Bosch, and exchanging with Bosch's academic partner network are an essential part of doing a PhD at Bosch.Qualifications• Education: excellent Master degree in Computer Science or related field• Personality and working practice: a strong team player with a passion for tackling challenging problems, self-motivated with good communication skills• Experience and knowledge: profound experience in deep learning, experience in applying deep learning to perception problems such as computer vision is a plus, strong background in algorithmics and/or mathematics, in-depth knowledge of contemporary machine learning methods and tools, proven programming skills in Python and experience in deep learning frameworks such as, e.g., TensorFlow/PyTorch/JAX, experience in writing scientific publications is a plus• Languages: fluent in English (written and spoken), academic writing skills are a plusAdditional InformationBosch ResearchBosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)Please submit all relevant documents (incl. motivation letter, curriculum vitae, and certificates).Apply now in just 3 minutes!Need support during your applicationKevin Heiner (Human Resources)+49 711 811 12223Need further information about the jobJan Hendrik Metzen (Functional Department)+49 711 811 48904"

Research aims at developing novel system architectures, i.e. considering the interaction of all elements in this system of systems. In this way, the DLR Institute is working to establish the future paradigm for the design and optimization of products and systems. Using this, innovative aircraft systems can be realized in a time- and cost-efficient manner.For this purpose, digital design methods such as Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) are increasingly applied. This development is made possible by holistic approaches to modeling the product and operating environment, which are accompanied by a steady increase... in digital models and data along the entire product life cycle. The handling of these very large amounts of data, respectively their evaluation and especially the derivation of knowledge for the design of improved products represents a central challenge in todays product development processes. A promising approach to make interdependencies in the ever-growing design space tangible and usable is found in the application of machine learning (ML) methods, whose rapid development has produced a variety of possibilities for knowledge inference based on large data sets in recent years. In addition to the increasing understanding of dependencies in the higher-level design space, there is the possibility of generating knowledge fragments for generative product design based on Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) techniques. Enabling this capability enlarges the potential to obtain even better products by effectively evaluating and including previously unused data in the design process.Therefore, we are looking for a new employee, having PhD aspirations, focusing on the identification of which ML methods are most suited for knowledge inference along the entire design process and to work out how these can be made accessible in the design process for the design of future complex system architectures in aviation in a user-oriented way.Your main tasks will be: development of methodological competences in the field of machine learning (ML) identification of existing data/data sets along the entire aviation system, as well as their classification with regard to their suitability for knowledge inference development and user-oriented provision of software to support data exploration and knowledge inference using ML methodsThis research center is part of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers. With more than 42,000 employees and an annual budget of over  5 billion, the Helmholtz Association is Germanys largest scientific organisation"
