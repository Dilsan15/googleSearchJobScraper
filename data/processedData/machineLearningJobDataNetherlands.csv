This data consists of 600 parameter types in nested structures that can be defined by customers in exposure recipes, sub-recipes and lot definition messages. This data can be transferred to the scanner via automated interfaces where the data will be subjected to validations and similar operations. The execution of these operations needs to be completed within specified timeouts, but actual duration depends on the specific data content.Your assignmentAlthough performance depends on actual data content, the exact factors and cross-dependencies in content that determine the durations are not... known. It is also not expected that it is feasible to determine these empirically. To avoid customer impact, a system-level performance test is however still required that will cover the full scanner scope and can be used to safeguard against regression in system interface behavior.The test (e.g. python / C++) must allow for reliable performance monitoring when new parameters are being added without the test needing to be updated. Use machine learning to establish correlations between parameter settings and performance, establishing a model for future parameter extension to be validated.Goals to achieve:• Design and develop a reliable performance test that incorporates a sustainable test strategy, optimizing test execution time and coverage;• Apply machine learning strategies to create a robust test that can handle new parameters without requiring code changes;• Deploy the tests in the delivery process;• Defining strategies to train the test and provide sufficient datasets;• Rolling out test in a dynamic environment (new parameters are added 10-15 times per year) with stakeholders;• Ensure tester can be executed on different platforms (local, cloud);Your profileTo be the perfect match for this internship, you:• are a student in Machine learning, Computer Science, Industrial or Data Engineering;• have knowledge in C, C++ and Python;• have experience with UML and requirements engineering;• are open minded and willing to learn;• have great communication skills in English, both verbal and written.This is a graduation internship for bachelor students and graduation/apprentice internship for master students.

Within CASA the Computational Illumination Optics group, https://www.win.tue.nl/martijna/Optics/, is working on design methodologies for non-imaging optics and on improved simulation tools.BackgroundIllumination optics plays an important role in modern society. Products like mobile phones, lamps, car headlights, road lighting and even satellites all utilize illumination optics. A good optical design determines, for example, the energy efficiency of illumination devices, the minimization of light pollution or the sensitivity of sensors in satellites.The design of novel, sophisticated optical systems requires advances in the... mathematical description and numerical simulation methods for these systems. The optics applied in illumination is non-imaging, in contrast to for example a camera lens which is imaging. In non-imaging optics we study the transfer of light from a source to a target. The key problem is to design optical systems that convert a given source energy distribution into a desired target distribution.Project descriptionFreeform optics, a branch of geometrical optics, is concerned with the design of optical surfaces, either reflectors or lenses, that convert a given source light distribution into a desired target distribution. An example is a single reflector that transforms the emittance of an LED source into an intensity distribution in the far field, as used for street lighting.The governing laws are the principles of geometrical optics (law of reflection/refraction) and conservation of energy. Geometrical optics gives the optical map from source to target, and combined with energy conservation, this gives rise to the so-called Monge-Ampre equation, which is a second order, nonlinear partial differential equation.Figure 1. On the left a reflector that transforms the energy distribution of a frog to a prince. In the second picture we show the source distribution, in the third the optical map and in the last figure the results of a verification based on raytracing: the system gives indeed the prince.nderschriftIn recent years, we have developed tools to solve the Monge-Ampre equation for many optical systems. So, given the source and target energy distributions, we can calculate the optical geometry immediately, see Figure 1 where we have computed the surface of a reflector that transforms a frog into a prince. These inverse tools have some limitations, e.g., the methods assume an infinitesimal source dimension (point source). However, in reality the sources have a finite size. In addition, effects like absorption, scattering and Fresnel reflections are not considered in the inverse design methodology.To overcome these shortcomings of inverse methods, we would like to apply in this project techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence. As a first approach we imagine the following: Using and extending the available tool chain, it is possible to generate a large set of optical geometries and calculate the corresponding light distributions, which include effects from finite source, absorption etc. With this set we train a neural network to find new optical geometries for desired light distributions.TasksAs a PhD student your tasks are the following:Perform scientific research in the described domain.Present results at international conferences.Publish results in scientific journals.Participate in activities of the group and the department.Assist SC-staff in teaching undergraduate and graduate courses.Job requirementsWe are looking for talented, enthusiastic PhD candidates who meet the following requirements:A MSc in (applied) mathematics, physics, computer science or a related discipline with a strong background in computational physics;Experience with Matlab and preferably C or C++;Creative, pro-active team player with good analytical skills;Good communicative skills in English, both written and oral.Conditions of employmentA meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network.

Data Science | Computer Science Internship (non-thesis): Predict part failures,NA,2023-01-30 12:31:41,https://www.google.com/search?q=Machine+Learning+Jobs+Netherlands&ibp=htl;jobs&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwirjduPhPD8AhWlJX0KHZV0AuoQutcGKAF6BAgREAU#htivrt=jobs&htidocid=F0A43eixxxEAAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D&fpstate=tldetail,ASML,NA,NA,"Veldhoven, Netherlands","IntroductionAre you a student with a background in Computer Science or Data Science Do you have experience with data analytics and machine learning Are you self-driven Then this internship might be interesting for you!Background informationASML has thousands of lithography machines operating 24/7 at chip factories throughout the world. Due to their extreme accuracy, problems with lithography machines occur quite regularly. Downtime in a high-end chip factory is extremely costly: nominal costs for customers can be $20 per second of unscheduled downtime.One way to prevent unscheduled machine down is to predict the failures before they happen. By predicting the failures,machine down and part swap/repair can be scheduled and preparation for fixing the issue can be done in advance.Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimates the remaining time that a component in a production line is able to function in accordance with its intended purpose before warranting replacement. By taking RUL... into account, engineers can schedule maintenance, optimize operating efficiency, and avoid unplanned downtime. For this reason, estimating RUL is a top priority in predictive maintenance programs.Predictive modelling largely overlaps with the field of machine learning. These models can be trained over time to respond to new data or values, delivering the results to the business needs.Your assignmentIn this assignment based on life time data, history of the failures on similar machines and degradation conditions, you will study the behavior of failure indicators and decide on the best method to predict RUL with a high confidence level in a specified confidence interval.To maximize the availability of the machine and reduce the cost, the prediction should be accurate to prevent early repairs (when the part can still function but a swap is scheduled) as well as late repairs (too late when the machine fails before the scheduled repair).The challenge is to provide RUL with a confidence level above 90% and confidence interval that prevents early and late swaps/repairs.Your profileTo be the perfect match for this internship, you:• are a student with a background in Computer Science or Data Science;• have experience with data analytics, particularly with machine learning;• are proactive and self-driven;• have great communication skills in English and analytical skills.This is an apprentice internship for master students, with a minimum duration of 6 months, 5 days per week, starting as soon as possible.Please note that we can only consider students who are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship.Diversity and inclusionASML is an Equal Opportunity Employer that values and respects the importance of a diverse and inclusive workforce.
