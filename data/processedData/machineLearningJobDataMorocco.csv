Phd : Adding Interpretability Into Automatic Crop Classification Using Deep...,NA,2023-01-30 12:30:42,https://www.google.com/search?q=Machine+Learning+Jobs+Morocco&ibp=htl;jobs&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwimzM__g_D8AhXZMjQIHVj-CE4QutcGKAF6BAgPEAU#htivrt=jobs&htidocid=F-Hvfu-PIXoAAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D&fpstate=tldetail,Mohammed VI Polytechnic University,Full-time,NA,Morocco,"Nowadays, considering the continuous population growth and the limited availability of food, it is necessary to monitor agricultural activities on a regular basis, so as to allow for increased efficiency in food production, while protecting natural ecosystems. In this context, crop classification can be used to provide information on production and thus become a useful tool for developing sustainable plans and reducing environmental problems associated with agriculture. Therefore, timely collection and analysis of data from large crop areas is of great interest.Traditionally, such analysis is carried out using computational tools and satellite image processing with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques-especially those based on deep learning. Although several efficient deep learning techniques (such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks) have emerged in the field of multispectral image analysis, the problem of crop classification still needs more accurate, and... in-biological-context interpretable solutions.This PhD proposal is aimed at exploring and developing AI technologies that incorporate elements of molecular biology and OMICs in the study of crops in such a way that a good trade-off balance between accuracy and interpretability in crop classification tasks can be achieved.
