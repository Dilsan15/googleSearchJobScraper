Flexible work arrangements can be negotiated with the right candidate.Be part of the Australian Institute for Machine Learning  the largest computer vision and machine learning research group in Australia and contribute to world leading Augmented Reasoning research projectsThe Centre for Augmented Reasoning, headquartered within the Australian Institute for Machine Learning, is seeking to recruit fifteen Grant-Funded Researchers at Level B or Level C in augmented reasoning machine learning for 12 research projects across 4 Research Themes.AIML is Australias leading research institute in machine learning and artificial intelligence. AIMLs computer vision research is among the best in the world. With world-leading... researchers, modern facilities and an innovative culture, were committed to delivering research that is highly valued by our local and global communities. Located at Lot Fourteen, Adelaide, AIML is the largest computer vision and machine learning group in Australia with more than 170 members including academics, research staff, and students.The institute works on a mixture of fundamental and commercially oriented research projects in computer vision and machine learning. Find out more at www.adelaide.edu.au/aimlThe Centre for Augmented Reasoning (CAR) is a $20M investment by the (then) Department of Education, Skills and Employment in people and research to make computers better at interacting with humans so that all technology is easier and safer to use. Managed under AIML, the Centre is supporting Advanced Reasoning research through grants and PhD scholarships, facilitating innovation and rapid commercialisation, and increasing AI literacy and engagement in Australia.The postdoctoral researcher for Learning to build a 3D mesh for computer graphics, in CAR Research Theme of Photogrammetry and 3D Modelling, will be supervised by Associate Professor Anthony Dick. The role will contribute to the centres objective to progress computer vision using 3D sensor technologies to better suit applications beyond simple viewing.This project proposes a new geometry processing pipeline capable of transforming unstructured 3D data acquired with commodity sensors, into a well-structured fit for purpose polygonal mesh. The output of this processing can be used directly in the industrial contexts that make intensive use of structured 3D assets, like manufacturing, games, computer-aided design, or animations.The research will include:• applying supervised learning techniques to derive mesh representations that are amenable to structural analysis• processing the datasets of modelled meshes to learn how the connectivity is related to geometric features at different scales• exploiting this knowledge to build a novel modelling tool capable of replicating the manual modelling process on an input point cloud• exploring the use of externally imposed constraints on the mesh construction, such as suitability for 3D printing or other manufacturing process.The project will deliver significant science outcomes by combining externally imposed 3D geometric priors and rules with automated learning and reasoning. By bridging the gap between cheap to acquire but low value point clouds, and high value hand crafted 3D meshes, this research can deliver benefits in downstream application areas such as small-scale manufacturing, digital content creation, and digital heritage.To be successful at Level B you will need:• A PhD in computer science or a related discipline, or equivalent industry experience• Programming experience and expertise in Matlab, Python, or C++, or other relevant languages• Experience and demonstrable expert knowledge in one or more of the following areas: computer graphics, supervised machine learning, computational geometry.• Track record of publications in top-tier machine learning, computer vision, artificial intelligence and/or robotics conferences and/or journals, commensurate with experience and opportunity• A strong work ethic, and the ability to work well independently, and as a member of a broader team, including with industrial partnersIn addition to the above, to be successful at Level C you will also need:6.

The role will contribute to the centres objective to progress computer vision using 3D sensor technologies to better suit applications beyond simple viewing.This project proposes a new geometry processing pipeline capable of transforming unstructured 3D data acquired with commodity sensors, into a well-structured fit for purpose polygonal mesh. The output of this processing can be used directly in the industrial contexts that make intensive use of structured 3D assets, like manufacturing, games, computer-aided design, or animations.The research will include:applying supervised learning techniques to derive mesh representations that are amenable to structural analysisprocessing the datasets of modelled meshes to learn how the connectivity is related to geometric features at different scalesexploiting this knowledge to build a novel modelling tool capable of replicating the manual modelling process on an input point cloudexploring the use of externally imposed constraints on the mesh construction, such as suitability for 3D printing or other manufacturing process.The project will deliver significant science outcomes by combining externally imposed 3D geometric priors and rules with automated learning and reasoning. By bridging the gap between cheap to acquire but low value point clouds, and high value hand crafted 3D meshes, this research can deliver benefits in downstream application areas such as small-scale manufacturing, digital content creation, and digital heritage.To be successful at Level B you will need:A PhD in computer science or a related discipline, or equivalent industry experienceProgramming experience and expertise in Matlab, Python, or C++, or other relevant languagesExperience and demonstrable expert knowledge in one or more of the following areas: computer graphics, supervised machine learning, computational geometry.Track record of publications in top-tier machine learning, computer vision, artificial intelligence and/or robotics conferences and/or journals, commensurate with experience and opportunityA strong work ethic, and the ability to work well independently, and as a member of a broader team, including with industrial partnersIn addition to the above, to be successful at Level C you will also need:6.
