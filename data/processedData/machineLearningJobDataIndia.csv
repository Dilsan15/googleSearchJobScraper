A good part of India is now getting internetconnectivity thanks to cheap smartphones and Jio. The non-English speaking internet userswill balloon to about 600 million users out of the total 750 million internet users in India by2020. This will make the vernacular segment one of the largest segments in the world -almost 2x the size of the US population. The vernacular segment has very few products thatthey can use on the internet.One large human need is that of sharing thoughts and connecting with people of the samecommunity on the basis of language and common interests. Twitter serves this need globallybut the experience is mostly in English. Theres a large unaddressed need for these vernacularusers to express themselves in their mother tongue and connect with others from theircommunity. Koo... is a solution to this problem.About KooKoo was founded in March 2020, as a micro-blogging platform in both Indian languages andEnglish, which gives a voice to the millions of Indians who communicate in Indianlanguages.Currently available in Assamese, Bengali, English, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil andTelugu, Koo enables people from across India to express themselves online in their mothertongues. In a country where under 10% of the population speaks English as a nativelanguage, Koo meets the need for a social media platform that can deliver an immersivelanguage experience to an Indian user, thereby enabling them to connect and interact witheach other. The recently introduced Talk to Type enables users to leverage the voiceassistant to share their thoughts without having to type. In August 2021, Koo crossed 10million downloads, in just 16 months of launch.Since June 2021, Koo is available in Nigeria.Founding TeamKoo is founded by veteran internet entrepreneurs  Aprameya Radhakrishna (CEO,Taxiforsure) and Mayank Bidawatka (Co-founder, Goodbox & Coreteam, redBus).Technology Team & CultureThe technology team comprises sharp coders, technology geeks and guys who have beenentrepreneurs or are entrepreneurial and extremely passionate towards technology.
