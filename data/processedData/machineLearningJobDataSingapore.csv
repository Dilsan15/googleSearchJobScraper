This project focuses on the service life prediction of these materials, subject to the cyclical environmental loading conditions. A mechanism based degradation model for the selected faade material is to be developed, calibrated and validated against laboratory data obtained from accelerated weathering tests. To capture the intricate relations between different environmental loads, the project will work towards the development of a coupled mechanism model (e.g. hydro-thermal degradation), to enable the climate parameters (temperature cycles, precipitation, etc.) to be better implemented in the service life prediction. The candidate will have to use machine learning techniques to come out with prediction models using the test data from the field... specimens, accelerated weathering samples and also numerical simulation results. Job Requirements  Possess at least a recognised Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computational Physics or any disciplines relevant to the project.  Proficient in: mechanics of materials, non-linear finite element techniques (theory, numerical implementation, analysis) and numerical methods  At least 2 years of relevant experience in constitutive model development, writing of subroutines for FE implementation and machine Learning.  Open to fixed-term contract Covid-19 Message At NUS, the health and safety of our staff and students are one of our utmost priorities, and COVID-vaccination supports our commitment to ensure the safety of our community and to make NUS as safe and welcoming as possible.

However, concerns over trust and security have hindered the sharing of data between organizations. Much efforts have been focused on breaking the data silos, but the silos are inherently difficult to break at the data level, as personal or proprietary data are often involved. We posit that the ML models can be more amenable for sharing as they are inherently more compact and self-contained with purpose-compiled knowledge from the data. Rather than requiring the learning collaborators to contribute their private data, this project will focus on enabling collaborative machine learning through allowing the collaborators to share heterogeneous black-box models, and to be appropriately incentivized based on their self-interests. Given that most current research are focused on the data level, this project will develop new... model-centric collaborative machine learning methods, as well as new notions for trustable model-centric sharing and effective model management techniques for real-world model-centric platforms. This 4-year project will be led by Prof See-Kiong Ng and be conducted by the leading international and inter-disciplinary AI and data science researchers in the institutes new Trusted Collaborative Machine Learning (Trusted CollabML) Lab. The CollabML Lab is a collaboration between the Institute of Data Science, the Department of Computer Science, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS), the School of Law at the Singapore Management University (SMU), as well as the Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The project team will design and develop a trustable, operational and legally-compliant model-centric sharing platform, validated with real-world data and applications provided by industry partners. Such a platform will be instrumental for powering a data-driven AI innovation ecosystem for a vibrant digital economy through trusted self-interest-driven sharing of learned machine intelligence. The Role The Research Assistant will be responsible for designing and implementing efficient and robust systems, and applications for algorithms and methodologies based on state-of-the-art research in machine learning and big data for collaborative machine learning.
