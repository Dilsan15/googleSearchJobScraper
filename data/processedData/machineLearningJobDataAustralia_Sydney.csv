Yes, were a technology company and yes, were leveraging the latest AI technologies, but people are at the heart of everything we do. annalise.ai was formed in early 2020 through a unique partnership between harrison.ai and Australia's largest medical imaging service provider, I-MED Radiology Network. Since then, weve scaled rapidly to over 200 employees worldwide and were focused on creating AI solutions that help radiologists diagnose medical images. Our first product, the world's most comprehensive AI clinical decision-support solution for chest x-rays, is already in use by 1 in 4 radiologists in Australia and rolling out to hundreds more. This solution is capable of detecting 124 findings and was recently featured in peer-reviewed publication, Lancet Digital Health journal. And were just getting started. Help us shape the future of AI in medical imaging. And most importantly, help us make a real difference in peoples lives. Whats next If youre inspired by what we're up to, please apply now and we'll be in touch soon. We are proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. Diversitys not a buzzword here, its in our DNA.

Forecasting the future state of a high-dimensional complex multi-scale system is a challenge we face in areas ranging from climate science to epidemiology. Even when basic physical mechanisms have been identified, the actual evolution equations are... often unknown. This project will develop a computationally cheap machine learning framework for forecasting. We will develop mathematical theory underpinning the novel methodology, as well as applying it to the perennial problem of subgrid-scale parametrisation in climate modelling. Furthermore, we will apply dynamical systems theory to understand existing machine learning algorithms.
