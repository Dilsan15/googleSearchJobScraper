• Play an active role in the architecture at Matcha to better support our growing user base and scaling needs

What you could work on
• Scoring Review: Producing a score is one thing. Allow non-data people to understand it and agree with it is another thing. We are actively working on explaining how our model decides on the score of a customer.
• Sales Process Design Tool: Understanding and modeling a sales process is not easy. Every company has its approach, and it's often not very well documented (or even shared inside the company). Being able to capture this knowledge is key to scoring their customer correctly.
• Data Stack API: Our data stack is complex and needs to be managed by an API. This API will allow us to create a new data source programmatically, monitor the ingestion schedule, and abstract the complexity of data processing to our business layer.

The Technical Stack

Backend:
• Kotlin
• Spring
• PostgreSQL
• ElasticSearch

Frontend:
• Vue.js 2
• Typescript
• Vuetify

Data:
• Airflow
• DBT
• BigQuery
• Python

Infrastructure (Full GCP):
• Docker
• GKE
• Terraform

Why should you join us?
• We are craftsmen: We are proud of what we do and put our love and craftsmanship into everything we ship. You will have total ownership of your work.
• We are a product-centric company: We believe that user experience is crucial and are obsessed with creating something our users love and use every day.
• We hire only A-Players: We are building the core team of what the future of Matcha will be. Therefore you will work with the best in the world in their field (yes, for real) and learn as much as you will teach.
• It's the very beginning: It's a rare occasion to live the exponential growth of a startup from the ground up.
• We are fair: High-level performers deserve high-level pay and equities.
