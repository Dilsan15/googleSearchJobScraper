Machine Learning Engineer - Senior

The Machine Learning team sits within our Computer Vision Engineering Department, who are responsible for delivering real-time, end-to-end solutions for tracking balls, players and other relevant sports objects, for the purposes of sports officiating and data analytics.

One example of our tracking products is SkeleTRACK - a real-time ball and skeletal tracking currently deployed to major US sports leagues and European football leagues. Our Computer Vision and Machine Learning team are almost entirely responsible for building this technology. We are now looking at how we improve and extend this into more sports and services - more than likely solving more complex and challenging problems!

A day in the life of a Machine Learning Engineer

As a Machine Learning engineer at Hawk-Eye Innovations, you will... be part of an agile team that is responsible for the end to end pipeline for our Machine Learning models. This involves tasks such as working with our annotation teams to get the best annotated data and providing them with the best tools on our annotations platform; keeping track of live model performance and detect common failure cases; integrating models and features into our SkeleTRACK products; keeping up to date with the latest research; and designing new ML models, whether real-time or otherwise.

You will partner closely with our product team to establish requirements and develop innovative solutions to the most complex challenges within sports technology. You can expect to solve significant problems whilst leading and coaching more junior members of the team as we brainstorm solutions, conduct research and find the best approach. You will be working in a weekly Kanban cycle to deliver game-changing technology and will support the configuration and deployment of our products that are delivered on a global scale.

Key Responsibilities

Key Responsibilities

We innovate to build incredible ball and player tracking solutions, applying that to sports officiating but also broadcast video, coaching and fan engagement. Computer Vision and Machine Learning is pivotal to all of this and is the core competency of the Hawk-Eye Engineering team.

You will be working with a highly skilled set of engineers. As the business and team have grown rapidly, so has the emphasis on creating a team and structure that can enable us to continue to create innovative solutions and products.

Our Development Team

Our Development team at Hawk-Eye Innovations is multi-faceted. It is responsible for building technology that unpins all of the services delivered by the wider operational business. We have expertise in a variety of engineering disciplines, including:
• Computer Vision
• Machine Learning
• Video content management and streaming
• Cloud data platforms
• Web technologies
• Computer Graphics
• Data Science

Each of the above teams collaborates closely to deliver technologies across a number of sports, products, and services. One of our core services is ball and player tracking in sports such as tennis, cricket, football, and US sports like major league baseball. We build end-to-end solutions - real-time tracking, data warehousing, low latency data streaming, and broadcast enhancements, including automated officiating (e.g. Hawk-Eye Live, Tennis).

Our VAR system is used to help officiate in the biggest football competitions in the world, including the top leagues in England, Germany, Spain, Italy, France, and the USA, the UEFA Champions League, and the FIFA World Cup. Outside of football, our products are used in almost every major sport in the world, including the Olympics, American football, baseball, basketball, ice hockey, cricket, tennis, and golf.

In addition to officiating, we are also used as a broadcast tool, providing the ability to add replays and graphics to TV productions. This ranges from working with massive productions like the Masters golf tournament (where we won a Sports Emmy for our product that allowed viewers at home to view every shot of the tournament at the click of a button) to smaller events on the tennis tour where we provide the entire production, including cameras which we remotely control to follow the play.

Ultimately, we are flexible in our approach to software development. We do all of this with the support of the Product team, who facilitate projects and product development while delivering the technology into the hands of our operational teams.

We actively balance the focus of product development and innovation, appreciating that both are extremely important to the success of our business. While we adopt a robust approach to software development we are aggressive with our innovation - this includes regular Hack-Days, creating opportunities to experiment, initiating creative ideas, and embracing failures (but failing fast).

As part of our Development Team, you will be part of creating software that is integral to some of the biggest sporting tournaments, leagues, and federations in the world. You’ll be able to see the results of your work on live TV, along with billions of sports fans around the world whose experience will be augmented by our software.

Our Development Team Culture

Our Development team at Hawk-Eye is built on a culture shaped by openness and honesty, along with a desire to push the boundaries of technology and innovation. We are constantly learning so that we can keep up to date with modern ways of doing things, and we use our code review process to challenge each other to improve and work in the best way possible, regardless of seniority in the team. We have areas that specific individuals are responsible for, but we always work collaboratively so that everyone can gain knowledge across our codebase, and areas of responsibility change over time as team members progress. We are agile and strive for the highest quality in everything we produce, whilst always ensuring that the code we write is clear and maintainable.

G-Research is Europe’s leading quantitative finance research firm. We hire the brightest minds in the world to tackle some of the biggest questions in finance. We pair this expertise with machine learning, big data, and some of the most advanced technology available to predict movements in financial markets.

The role

Machine Learning is an integral part of G-Research’s work. We use applied ML techniques to develop successful investment management strategies; it is one of the core drivers of our overall performance and success. ML has long been a key tool at G-Research and we count among our number a range of ICML and NeurIPS published researchers.

Joining our leading ML team, you will have huge amounts of (clean) data and massive compute at your fingertips, with which you will predict the future of financial markets. Because this is a very mature prediction problem, finding the 1% of difference, working at the very cutting edge of developments, is the place where... success happens. You will, in effect, be incentivised to explore the state-of-the-art.

While we start with the standard ML toolkit, to make a model work our researchers really need to understand what’s going on, not just throw an out-of-the-box solution at a dataset. This involves applying machine learning methods drawn from diverse areas such as neural networks, reinforcement learning, deep learning, non-convex optimisation, Bayesian non-parametrics, NLP and approximate inference. Unlike pure problems, our researchers get near-instantaneous feedback on their work in the form of absolute numbers: success is highly measurable and has direct impact on the business.

As a team, we read the latest publications in the field and discuss them within the firm’s vibrant research community and attend the leading conferences worldwide (e.g. NeurIPS, ICML, ACL etc.).

In this research role you will be able to develop and test your ideas with real-world data in an environment that resembles academia.

Who are we looking for?

The ideal candidate will at a minimum have experience in the following areas:
• Either a post-graduate degree in machine learning or a related discipline, or commercial experience developing novel machine learning algorithms. We will also consider exceptional candidates with a proven record of success in online data science competitions (e.g. Kaggle).
• Experience in one or more of deep learning, reinforcement learning, non-convex optimisation, Bayesian non-parametrics, NLP or approximate inference.
• Excellent reasoning skills and mathematical ability are crucial: off the shelf methods don’t always work on our data so you will need to understand how to develop your own models.
• Strong programming skills and experience working with Python, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks is desirable. Experience with object oriented programming would be beneficial.
• Publications at top conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR etc. is highly desirable.

Why should you apply?
• Highly competitive compensation plus annual discretionary bonus
• Lunch provided (via Just Eat for Business) and dedicated barista bar
• 30 days’ annual leave
• 9% company pension contributions
• Informal dress code and excellent work/life balance
• Comprehensive healthcare and life assurance
• Cycle-to-work scheme
• Monthly company events

G-Research is committed to cultivating and preserving an inclusive work environment. We are an ideas-driven business and we place great value on diversity of experience and opinions.

• Mentoring data scientists and engineers in best practices and new technologies;
• Creating reusable, scalable tools to enable better delivery of ML systems; and
• Implementing and developing Faculty’s view on what it means to operationalise ML software.
• You will support both technical and non-technical stakeholders to deploy ML to solve real-world problems. To enable this, we work in cross functional teams with representation from commercial and data science specialities to cover all aspects of AI product delivery.

We’re a rapidly growing organisation, so roles are dynamic and subject to change. Your role will evolve alongside business needs, but you can expect your key responsibilities to include:
• Scoping projects
• Providing technical support during Business Development
• Managing and Mentoring technical staff
• Technical Delivery

Who We're Looking For

At Faculty, your attitude and behaviour are just as important as your technical skill. We look for individuals who can support our values, foster our culture, and deliver for our organisation.

We like people who combine expertise and ambition with optimism -- who are interested in changing the world for the better -- and have the drive and intelligence to make it happen. If you’re the right candidate for us, you probably:
• Think scientifically, even if you’re not a scientist - you test assumptions, seek evidence and are always looking for opportunities to improve the way we do things.
• Love finding new ways to solve old problems - when it comes to your work and your professional development, you don’t believe in ‘good enough’. You always seek new ways to solve old challenges.
• Are pragmatic and outcome-focused - you know how to balance the big picture with the little details and know a great idea is useless if it can’t be executed in the real world.
• Excellent communication skills;
• Experience in working directly with clients and end users;
• Requirements gathering;
• Technical planning and scoping;
• User acceptance testing;
• A drive to learn new technologies and novel applications of existing technologies;
• Experience in leading technical delivery; and
• Technical mentoring

To succeed in this role, you’ll need demonstrable in the following:
• Software Engineering in Python
• Linux system management
• Docker/Containerisation
• CI/CD Technologies
• Automated testing
• AWS, GCP or Azure experience
• Systems design and maintenance

What we can offer you

The Faculty team is diverse and distinctive, and we all come from different personal, professional and organisational backgrounds. We all have one thing in common: we are driven by a deep intellectual curiosity that powers us forward each day. This curiosity pushes us to seek truth and understanding in everything we do, to execute work in a nimble and pragmatic manner, to foster talent in one another and always to challenge assumptions.

Faculty is the professional challenge of a lifetime. You’ll be surrounded by an impressive group of brilliant minds working to advance our goal of making artificial intelligence real. Our consultants, product developers, business development specialists, operations professionals and more all bring something unique to Faculty, and you’ll learn something new from everyone you meet. You’ll also have the opportunity to make your mark on a high-growth start-up now poised to expand internationally.

Fostering talent is one of our core values, it’s built into our culture and what we offer. Faculty was founded by people who are passionate about continuous learning, and adding value to our people.

Some of our benefits…..
• Genuinely flexible working: We believe people have needs, responsibilities and interests that require something different to a strict working day. We trust people to organise and take accountability for their own work and do our best to support their lives outside Faculty. We provide you with all you need to work from home, including a laptop, keyboard, chair…even Sony headphones!
• Equity, we want you to benefit from Faculty’s growth and success.
• Unlimited holidays: We encourage each other to use this time to take a break, work on personal projects, or to spend time with their friends and family.
• Fantastic private health, optical and dental cover, for you & your family - including 24/7 unlimited virtual private GP appointments and covering pre-existing medical conditions.
• Access to mental health coaching with Sanctus
• Breakfast & Lunch daily, and more fruit, drinks and snacks than you could ever eat (for office-based employees).
• We work hard and make sure we enjoy what we do. So we have frequent socials and informal get-togethers to help make sure you enjoy your time with us. You’ll make friends and professional connections that will last a lifetime.

• Love finding new ways to solve old problems - when it comes to your work and your professional development, you don’t believe in ‘good enough’. You always seek new ways to solve old challenges.
• Are pragmatic and outcome-focused - you know how to balance the big picture with the little details and know a great idea is useless if it can’t be executed in the real world.
• Excellent communication skills;

This curiosity pushes us to seek truth and understanding in everything we do, to execute work in a nimble and pragmatic manner, to foster talent in one another and always to challenge assumptions.

Faculty is the professional challenge of a lifetime. You’ll be surrounded by an impressive group of brilliant minds working to advance our goal of making artificial intelligence real. Our consultants, product developers, business development specialists, operations professionals and more all bring something unique to Faculty, and you’ll learn something new from everyone you meet.
