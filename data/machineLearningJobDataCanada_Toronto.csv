Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

To solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began... selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

Job Description

As a MLE within the Lifecycle ML team, you will lead projects that help with Square’s growth. The team exists to surface the right messages to the right sellers at the right time across all our go-to-market channels (web app, in-app, notifications, sms, email, mail, etc) as well as products. We provide sellers with remarkable personalized experiences using machine learning/deep learning to power the best product/feature/content recommendations.

Our algorithms derive value from our unique, rich, and rapidly growing data. We partner with business, product, operations and engineering teams to drive better decisions, automated and human, using sophisticated modeling and machine learning. We’re a passionate team of hackers, statisticians, and optimizers who are resourceful in distilling questions, wrangling data, and driving impactful business decisions.

Qualifications
• Lead and drive cross functional machine learning/data science projects from beginning to end: build relationships with partner teams, frame and structure questions, collect and analyze data, research, prototype, and build out data science pipelines and models in production, as well as summarize and present methodology and key insights
• Use and learn a diverse set of techniques spanning machine learning (including deep learning), causal inference, and other forms of statistical modeling to solve import business and product problems
• Collaborate with business leaders, subject matter experts, and decision makers to develop success criteria and optimize new products, features, policies, and models
• Help build the next generation of data products at Square

You Have
• 4+ years industry experience in data science or machine learning-focused roles
• Practical experience and best practices in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, deep learning, natural language processing, informational retrieval to solve real world problems
• Experience working with product, design, and engineering to prioritize, scope, design, and deploy ML models
• Proficient in one of the following languages: Java, Python, Scala, or C++
• Experience in solving real world problems using one of the frameworks: PyTorch, Mxnet, Jax or related frameworks
• Familiarity with Linux/OS X command line, version control software (git), and general software development
• The ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences
• Excellent problem solving skills
• A strong desire to perform and grow in your role
