The Lab will research the state-of-art AI technologies to build the cornerstone for the intelligent management of autonomous driving networks.

As a Senior AI researcher your knowledge and experience in designing and building intelligent systems will be applied to solve challenging real-world problems in the areas of network assurance, network healing (fault prediction, root cause analysis, remediation actions planning) and network optimisation (control parameter optimisation, resource allocation), and predictive modelling.

Despite its great success, purely data-driven AI systems in general and Machine Learning systems in particular have their limits when dealing with training data that are insufficient, unbalanced or... contain very few examples of important rare events. There are two potential solutions to this inefficiency. First, the additional integration of prior knowledge (usually in some symbolic form) in the training and inference process, which leads to the notion of Knowledge-driven Machine Learning. Second, the incorporation of data-centric AI techniques, which seek to systematically engineer the data to improve its quality.

We are looking for enthusiastic, motivated AI researchers that have practical experience with knowledge-driven and data-centric AI methods. More specifically:
• Integration of knowledge into the learning and inference process, through the use of knowledge embedding or reasoning based on symbolic knowledge representations (i.e. knowledge graph, logic rules, algebraic equations).
• Graph data science to gain knowledge from relationships and structure in data in order to empower predictions.
• Learning and inference in small data regimes, through the use of few-shot learning.
• Continual Learning and inference that is robust to distributional drifts and that quickly adapts and generalises to these changes with few examples.

Key responsibilities include:
• Identify the state-of-art (both in industry and in academic literature) of AI technologies for solving problems in the domain of Autonomous Driving Networks.
• Contribute to rapid and iterative development of validated prototypes based on AI technologies, and benchmark alternative solutions.
• Work closely with Domain Experts, Data Engineers, and Data Scientists. Collaborate with product development teams and partners in Businesses to productionise AI technologies, including providing source code and design documents.

• PhD in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or related field.
• 5+ years of industrial research experience in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Operations Research, or related field.
• Strong practical experience with Machine Learning (i.e., Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Ensemble models, Clustering, Association relationship mining, Bayesian Networks).
• Experience with knowledge reasoning methods (i.e. neural methods via knowledge graph embedding, or symbolic methods via rule-based reasoning, and/or neuro-symbolic methods)

Research project

Dialogue systems aim to have high quality conversations with users, emulating natural conversation skills, all the while completing a task efficiently and improving user experience. Research into dialogue systems faces similar challenges to other areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with respect to evaluation of systems. How can we best evaluate systems so results are realistic, accurate, and reliable? Good evaluation of systems is vital to guide research in the most promising direction and to avoid following directions that unknowingly negatively impact the performance of systems from the perspective of human users. Dialogue systems research is thought to be the future of human computer interaction and providing a means of accurate evaluation in this area therefore remains a high priority in NLP. The topic is under-researched however possibly due to the significant challenges that lie in the development of good evaluation methods relative to other research areas.

The project involves development of successful methods of evaluation for dialogue systems, including human and automatic metric-based evaluation. On completion of the project, the researcher will have experience with integrating state-of-the-art dialogue models into crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, as well as using neural networks for automatic evaluation of dialogue quality. The work involved in this project as well as high impact publication venues will result in experience highly desired by companies such as Facebook, Google and LinkedIn to name but a few, in addition to being valuable for academic research careers in NLP and Machine Learning.

Contract: Full-time/Fixed Term

Tyndall National Institute is a leading European research centre in integrated ICT (Information and Communications Technology) hardware and systems. Specialising in both electronics and photonics – materials, devices, circuits and systems – we are globally leading in our core research areas of bio-photonics, bioelectronics, biomedical devices and systems. As the national institute for photonics and micro/nanoelectronics and a research flagship of UCC, the institute employs 600 researchers, engineers and support staff, including 120 full-time graduate students. Tyndall is the lead institute for the Irish Photonics Integration Centre (IPIC) and European Space Agency (ESA) Space Solutions Centre Ireland and hosts industry-aligned research centres; Microelectronic Circuits Centre Ireland (MCCI); International Energy Research Centre (IERC); and... the Centre for Future Networks and Communications (CONNECT).

Reporting to Prof. Padraig Cantillon-Murphy, this position involves the development of new algorithms including machine learning approaches for intelligent visualisation of tool position within magnetic tracking. The student will be based at the Tyndall National Institute with a student’s appointment in the School of Engineering, University College Cork.

Magnetic Tracking is a technology which enables the use of navigated instruments in image-guided interventions such as surgery without the use of x-rays. Magnetic tracking involves the use of frequency-modulated magnetic fields in the volume of interest. These fields are detected by tiny sensors (currently under development at MCCI) embedded within surgical tools and instruments. This approach works well in the absence of metal distortion of the magnetic field from other large medical equipment such as CT imaging machines.

The aim of this project is to develop new algorithms which provide intelligent visualisation of the tracked tool position. To date, the algorithm to determine the tracked tool position is determined by a non-linear least-squares regression approach without any additional input. This project will combine a priori tool position, supplementary sensor inputs and possibly machine learning approaches to determine an ‘intelligent’ tool position. This work will take place in Python but Matlab and C may also be used, particularly for edge-based computing. Finally, the project will look to provide a visualisation of the tool position in the virtual 3D Slicer environment. 3D Slicer is an open-source visualisation platform for image-guided surgery (https://www.slicer.org/) which is in C and Python.

Responsibilities

The candidate is expected to be creative, self-motivated, and should help create an efficiently and friendly atmosphere within the research team at UCC and Tyndall.
• Propose innovative approaches for intelligent visualisation of tool position in magnetic tracking.
• With guidance, implement visualisation of the optimised tool position in the 3D Slicer environment. This involves Python-based implementation using real and simulated tracking data, as well as interfacing with the system-level hardware already available in the research group.
• Engage in the dissemination of the results of the research, as directed by and with the support of senior Tyndall and UCC research staff.

Essential Criteria:
• The minimum academic qualification is a first or upper second class honours degree (or an equivalent international degree) in electrical engineering, industrial physics, electronic engineering, physics or related relevant discipline.
• The successful candidate will be highly analytical with good interpersonal and organisational skills.

Desirable Criteria
• Knowledge of Python, Matlab, Mathematica, and LaTeX.
• Good mathematical ability and knowledge of signal processing.
• Knowledge of interface between hardware and software systems.
• The successful candidate will be highly innovative with a strong desire to create world-beating solutions in the area of magnetic tracking for image-guided surgery.

An annual student stipend of €18,500 applies for this successful candidate for this position. Yearly University academic fees will paid by the Tyndall National Institute.

Postdoctoral Researcher

Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Bias Detection from Data to Model predictions

Insight Research Centre for Data Analytics, School of Computer Science

Ref. No. University of Galway 321-22

Applications are invited from suitably qualified candidates for a full-time fixed term 18-month contract position as a Postdoctoral Researcher with the SFI Insight Centre for Data Analytics based in the school of computer science at the University of Galway, Ireland. This position is funded mainly by Insight Research Centre and part-funded by Genesys and is available from 05 January 2023 to the contract end date of 30 June 2024.

The School of Computer Science is ambitious and growing, and we invite the new appointees to contribute to this together with us. The vision of the School of Computer Science is to build a strong and sustainable learning environment with world-recognised research that informs high-quality undergraduate and postgraduate teaching that... is inclusive and relevant to the needs of our stakeholders and society in general. The School of Computer Science was initially established in 1991 as the Information Technology Discipline, and became a School in 2019, recognising its growth and significance.

SFI Insight Centre for Data Analytics at the University of Galway is a branch of the nationwide Insight Centre for Data Analytics. The centre performs fundamental and applied research in a range of research areas to enable this, including machine/deep learning, multimodal data analysis, data streams, and sensor networks, knowledge discovery, natural language processing, social semantics, and social network analysis, among others. Research outcomes are applied in use cases across a range of domains, including eGovernment, financial services, manufacturing, eHealth, and Life Sciences.

Project: Machine learning, including deep learning, is used in various key decision-making systems. The model in DL has a set of hidden layers that learn from the input directly without any explicit feature engineering stage; which can lead to difficulty in understanding, interpretability, and explainability. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is trying to help in understanding the “black box” decision-making of ML/DL algorithms and models so that decisions are transparent, understandable, and trustworthy. Bias exists at various stages of a machine learning pipeline therefore, this project is about exploring XAI approaches, tools, models, opensource datasets, and understanding e.g., bias in datasets, algorithms, performance metrics for fairness, and then coming up with techniques or algorithms that can help in mitigating and/or avoiding bias.

Job Description: The postdoctoral researcher will be expected to perform a leading role in a project related to explainable artificial intelligence for bias detection in various stages of a machine learning pipeline. The researcher will have the opportunity to work with a team including academics, researchers from acidaemia, and industry to better understand the problem and come up with solutions that can help avoid bias and explain the decision of ML/DL models. The researcher will participate in meetings with academics and industry partner.
