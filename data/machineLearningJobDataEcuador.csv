We're a technology and finance startup on a mission to feed the world while saving the planet. We work across the $37 billion shrimp farming industry to help businesses grow with financial products and empower farmers to increase the supply of sustainably produced shrimp, leveraging technology including artificial intelligence / machine learning and computer vision to do so. It is an exciting time to join the company as we recently closed a $20M Series B round with mission-driven investors like Aqua-Spark, Obvious Ventures, and Tony Fadell (inventor of the iPhone and iPod) to name a few. Join our growing team of passionate and curious individuals to build and scale products that tackle real-world problems that help make the planet a better place to live!

In this role, you will:

Lead our Machine Learning team, the driving force behind XpertSea's competitive advantage (current team size is 5, and we will grow it as necessary to achieve business objectives.)

This means... leading the technical architecture of our ML/AI platform, establishing standards for code and processes

Managing the team day-to-day, aligning the team's work with the company's strategic and tactical goals.

Have one-on-one meetings with team leads, conduct performance reviews, and provide workplace and career guidance.

Develop computer vision and machine learning models to further empower aquaculture farmers, for example by:

Automatically detecting symptoms of disease in images of shrimp. Early detection of clinical signs helps sustainable production and increased profit for the producers.

Using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to estimate the weight of aquatic organisms in images taken with a common smartphone.

Investigate industry problems and use your skill set to solve those problems or give recommendations for company strategy

Work collaboratively with the Product team to define the way we look at industry problems and the best way to solve them. Get to work on moonshot ideas!

Want to work on the first shrimp facial recognition engine? Or rather you think the yield of a shrimp pond can be estimated using satellite imagery? No time but the present to try!

You'll have dedicated time to pursue any crazy ideas you think will change the industry for the better. We currently have one patent granted, with another three pending.

Keep up to date with literature and the ever evolving state of the art in machine learning and computer vision.

Who you are:

You have experience developing machine learning models in the real world and are familiar with the full ML development lifecycle - from data collection to model deployment.

You have led a team of AI/ML engineers through multiple development cycles towards putting into production and scale new functionality

You thrive working on projects that have not been defined 100% yet - creating, testing and improving on prototypes motivates you.

You are humble enough to experiment. You drive innovation with your curious and experimental mindset. You help the rest of the team learn with you and don't hide behind success cases.

You are comfortable with advanced statistical thinking and testing.

You know how to work with Python and its many research toolkits, but are also able to write robust and production-ready code. You're experienced with best practices and patterns in software design and development.

Sustainability and the belief that people can make a difference are part of your core motivators.
