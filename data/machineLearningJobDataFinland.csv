This position number is 01.Short description: The creation of art (i.e., visual, auditory, and other multimedia content) conceived by artificial intelligence has recently peaked as a shock and a harbinger of how the future may develop what comes to human ingenuity and the alleged uniquity of human experience, aesthetic perception, and self-concept in terms of autonomy and innovative capability. This phenomenon is perhaps most comprehensively visible in the dynamic and automatic generation of 3D multimodal environments and experience through multisense VR technology. In the future, it will be possible for AI to generate, dynamically and in real-time, content that maximizes the hedonic fit to the human observer based on the measurement of psychophysiological signals, creating limitless bioadaptive experiences. It is currently feasible and realistic to anticipate that these multimodal, high-fidelity, and highly interactive and engrossing experiences will become not only possible, but a part of our everyday in various domains, from psychotherapy and education to leisure. There are several dystopian and utopian future scenarios – as well as psychological, philosophical, and technological lines of engineering and inquiry – that can be wielded to better anticipate and even shape related, possible futures, as well as to understand their consequences. These issues not only pose practical questions to the industries where AI may be replacing previously human labor. They further question human experience and the philosophical premises of what conscious innovation, autonomy, and creativity mean.While the topic has become increasingly noticed – mostly as a curiosity of generative art – there are potential future ramifications related to how we design, experience and make sense of machine-generated content and, by consequence, human-made content, art, and experiences. They call for acute and cross-disciplinary research efforts that are literate in both machine intelligence and experience as well as human intelligence and experience. Holistic understanding of these emerging phenomena is needed for nurturing human prosperity and avoiding the dangers of future immersive AI-generated experiences becoming a modern oubliette.Tentative Research problems/questions: What are the current and potential future applications of AI-generated multimodal and bioadaptive experiences and what are their implications in understanding the human condition, innovation, and creativity?The research aims described below are to be intrinsically intertwined in informing and guiding each stage of the project. The three aims reflect 1) development and evaluation of AI systems, 2) understanding their wider socio-technological landscape, and 3) detection and explication of related implications and, consequently, frameworks or guidelines for future practitioners and researchers. Due research activities include:Mapping relevant current and future landscapes of AI-generated immersive experiences (state-of-the-art and futures research grounded in and projected from the capabilities of cutting-edge engineering)Conceiving, producing, and testing cutting-edge prototypes of AI-generated experiences (innovative demo experiences employing generative content trained on psychophysiological readings and evaluated in terms of its implications on individuals’ perception and understanding of self and creativity)Outlining possibilities and pitfalls, as well as design and ethical considerations of future of AI-generated experiencesRequirementsThe applicant needs to have a Master’s degree in any related social science, arts and humanities or engineering field, but preferably one related to the creative industries with a strong orientation to new technologies.
