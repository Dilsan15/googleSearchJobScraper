This means we’re constantly launching our Viaplay streaming service in new markets and on the lookout for talented, curious, driven professionals to join us on our journey.

Right now, we’re searching for a Machine Learning Engineer to the Applied Machine Learning team in our Stockholm office.

The role

As a ML Engineer you will bring to life recommender systems and other intelligent services that personalize and enhance the experience on our video on demand (VOD) streaming service Viaplay. 

You will work in an empathic and supportive team with other Data Scientists and Machine Learning... Engineers who share knowledge and experience in researching and developing data products. You love seeing things go into production and love the idea of seeing on-point recommendations produced by algorithms. You enjoy prototyping new data applications and work with teammates to bring projects onto all parts of our streaming service. You believe that maintaining models is a must in the data product development lifecycle.

You will be able to use and develop your machine learning and engineering competence on massive amounts of data from Viaplay’s Data Lake, containing everything from customer and viewing behavior to every detail about our movie, television, and sports content. As a ML Engineer you will play a key role to move data products to production, making it easier for customers to find the content they love and make the streaming service more intelligent. You will also help maintain ML systems so that the personalized experience continues to be personalized.

Our technology stack offers great opportunities to showcase and develop your data science skills. You will work on AWS for computation and storage, using Python and Spark to breathe life to cloud-based data products.

What we’re looking for

There are many consumer facing fintech products, but finance as a whole is virtually untouched by technology. Investment decisions are still being made out of pdf’s and “shark tank”-like processes rather than utilising the forecasting methods found at companies like Spotify or Google. This makes capital allocation riddled with bias and very ripe for disruption.

At ArK we’re convinced that by putting data and tech at the heart of finance we can impact how money flows and, in turn, create a more democratised and unbiased economy.

Today we offer founders access to our machine learning platform AIM. Through connecting their raw data we can fully understand what they’ve built without any bias; connecting what has been achieved historically into a simulated 5-year future. This prediction is the foundation for the transformational loans that we are able to issue, and a tool that founders get to keep for business optimisation.

AiM is using big data and machine learning to... analyse and predict companies’ current and future performance, to be used as a foundation for our frontier credit decision making. All in all, we thrive in the win-win data modelling where insights are valuable both for ArK as a lender, but also for our customer as a growth company. We build AiM to push beyond “credit scoring”, and to become the unrivalled place to plug in your company data, and get back valuable insights for optimising company growth — when our customers grow efficiently, everybody wins.

Being an ML leader at ArK

ArK has one of the most diverse sets of company data in the world, and it is growing at an incredible pace. The diversity and richness of data we want you to work with is essentially unheard of as we get raw data directly from our customers’ IT systems, and we want your help to make sense of it, both for us, and for our customers. The challenges here are unlike anywhere else as we’re striving to build generalizable modelling solutions that can be applied across an incredibly broad range of company data and business models.

Some of the problems that we help our customers solve are figuring out really detailed customer lifetime values (e.g. placing a value on our customers’ customers) and projecting their future revenue and cost growth — which conveniently enough is excellent data to base lending decisions on and tailor financing solutions to.

We’re also exploring advanced user churn modelling, credit scoring, customer business clustering and performance benchmarking and various clustering techniques to better understand businesses and their customers. As a leader at ArK we want you to help us define what’s possible and work on what’s valuable.

At ArK you will be a part of our tech and analytics teams and work with data engineers, data scientists, UX designers, data analysts and other ML professionals — bringing your unique skills to the table.

You are …
• … Someone who wants to lead and run Machine Learning projects from data crunching and prototyping — to quality assured models that run in a production environment.
• … Knowledgeable in the inner workings of the models you apply, and how to construct and optimise for suitable loss functions — and other similar concepts
• … Driven by impact and can deliver business value from projects fast, and then iterate over time to increase that value further
• … Interested both in the modelling and the engineering aspects of building good ML that works reliably
• … A future or current leader in the space who stays up to date and are not afraid to deploy modern techniques, and mentor and knowledge share with colleagues

Nice-to-have
• Experience from a product centric company
• Product and/or people leadership/management experience
• Experience writing blogs or articles, we really want to give back to the community and share our work and findings

More about who we are at ArK

ArK was founded in 2021 by a six-time entrepreneur, a world-class AI technology developer and a veteran banker. Since then we’ve carefully grown our team to 30 - all pitching in with their experience to build something that none of us has seen before.

We believe that the key to a great team culture is great people having a great time together. Our team is one to be part of for the long run, because you won’t want to leave. Our unique combination of startup mentality, experienced team and ambitious vision make ample room for possibilities to grow.

ArK is headquartered in Stockholm but we balance our time between being at the office and working remotely"
