Modern and future ships use radio communications to support the local situational awareness and autonomity. Short- and long-term communication performance has a direct effect on how well the ship's systems are able to utilize up-to-date information from other ships and land-based systems. Being able to predict the performance is crucial in supporting the ship to adapt to the expected level of connectivity on route.

The radio propagation channel behavior, including its statistical variation in time and space, depends on the location of transmitter and receiver, as well as the propagation conditions around both. The maritime channel, in addition, will depend on weather conditions that may change the sea surface conditions. These phenomena lead to location-dependent achievable data rates and reliability.

This work studies data-driven, machine learning trained spatial models that can be used to predict the achievable rates and reliabilities of the maritime channel, and... the related radio system.

The data sources foreseen are the radio system channel quality indicators at the physical layer, the location information, and eventually other data sources that can be used to improve the prediction accuracy. The PhD candidate will also work with real life propagation measurements from the Massive MIMO radio channel measurements in the Trondheim fjord.

This PhD project is a part of the PERSEUS doctoral programme: A collaboration between NTNU- Norway’s largest university, 11 top-level academic partners in 8 European countries, and 8 industrial partners within sectors of high societal relevance.

The position is located, at the present, at Campus Grimstad. The starting date is summer of 2023 or to be negotiated with the Faculty.The successful applicant will become part of a team of 13 researchers working on artificial intelligence, machine learning, wireless communications, and control theory for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This team spans three departments and the Center for Integrated Emergency Management of UiA, Delft University of Technology (The Netherlands), the University of Vigo (Spain), the University of California, San Diego, and Gradiant (Spain). This creates an interdisciplinary and international... collaboration environment designed to leverage the full potential of its members. Upon satisfactory performance, the hired appliacant will be offered the possibility of carrying out a funded research visit to the aforementioned institutions.ResponsibilitiesWhile households and smartphones in developed countries receive skyrocketing data rates through optical fibers and 5G communications, respectively, roughly one half of the world's population cannot connect to the internet. Even beyond developing economies, bringing data connectivity to areas where it cannot currently reach would drastically benefit applications such as the internet-of-things, smart agriculture/forestry, wildfire suppression, search-and-rescue missions, paramedical interventions, and, remarkably, emergency response to name a few.The successful applicant will conduct research in the project Ubiquitous Connectivity via Autonomous Airborne Networks (AirBonnet). This project comprises a set of key developments intended to develop the technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as multicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, zeppelins, and balloons, that autonomously navigate through the airspace to provide data connectivity in those locations where it is absent or unsatisfactory.Specifically, the UAVs in the targeted technology are equipped with a communication module that connects to the ground users on one side and to the cellular terrestrial infrastructure on the other side. The user information may even be relayed through multiple UAVs before reaching its destination. For this technology to be viable, the UAVs must be able to navigate without human supervision to locations with favorable propagation conditions, that is, where the signals that they receive from and transmit to the ground users and cellular infrastructure are not significantly blocked by obstacles such as buildings or mountains.The key approach in this project is to construct ""radio maps"" that describe the propagation conditions in a certain region. Using these maps, the UAVs rely on artificial intelligence algorithms to determine the appropriate locations and can even adapt to changes in the user positions and connectivity requirements as well as to coordinate with other UAVs. Our preliminary findings already showcase the ability of artificial deep neural networks to construct radio maps from a small number of measurements collected by the UAVs.This position involves theoretical and practical research. The advising model is designed so that the student can document that she/he can conduct research independently upon graduation by means of a strong publication record in top-end journals and conferences as well as a solid network of highly respected collaborators. This will set the student in an advantage position to find a position in the academia or industry after graduation.A prerequisite for employment is that the candidate must be admitted to UiA’s PhD program of the Faculty of Engineering and Science, Specialisation in Information and Comunication Technology. There, students need to complete a coursework component of 30 ECTS intended to provide the necessary background for conducting research in their area.

The Department of Electric Power Engineering (IEL), at the Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), invites applications for a PhD candidate position in “Optimal hydropower scheduling using advanced machine learning and data analytics”.

In Norway, hydropower is the primary source of electricity, and it accounts for 96% of electricity generation. Due to the long-term reservoir storage constraints in hydropower dominated systems, the resource scheduling should be done for a sufficiently long-time period and with an appropriate representation of uncertainties (such as inflow to reservoirs, wind power generation, demand etc.) Existing hydropower scheduling models face many shortcomings when dealing with such uncertainties.

The IntHydro project aims to develop and demonstrate a new hydropower scheduling tool based on machine learning techniques, which manages the hydropower plants more efficiently... and effectively through optimizing water resource management and multi-dispatch between hydropower and variable renewable energy sources.

In this context, the main task of the PhD candidate in the doctoral work will be two-fold. First, to integrate machine learning techniques in different stages of hydropower scheduling models and define comprehensive coupling principles between the strategic and operational modelling. Second, to develop a prototype for fundamental hydropower scheduling that allows modelling of RES on a detailed time scale.

Main supervisor: Associate Professor Jayaprakash Rajasekharan (NTNU). Co-supervisor: Professor Hossein Farahmand (NTNU).

This PhD project is a part of the PERSEUS doctoral programme: A collaboration between NTNU- Norway’s largest university, 11 top-level academic partners in 8 European countries, and 8 industrial partners within sectors of high societal relevance.
