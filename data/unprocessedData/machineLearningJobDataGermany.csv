State estimation could be of various kinds of which State-of-Charge (SOC) and State-of-Health (SOH) is what is commonly researched. For energy management of ESS, it is important to estimate the amount of energy that could be taken out of the ESS. This is termed as State-of-Energy (SOE) of ESS. The energy capacity varies according to the operation conditions, as can be seen in the following graph.Under higher current rate and/or higher temperature the ESS cannot deliver the defined nominal energy capacity. Thus, under dynamic current rates and temperatures the SOE has to be actively updated, based on which an optimal energy management strategy could be defined.SOE estimation works based on ESS models. But unfortunately, ESS modelling is not... straight forward and SOE estimation under external factors such as balancing, uneven temperature distribution in ESS, and others could make it a complex task overall. One of the ways to solve this problem is by utilizing Machine Learning (ML) techniques to build a black box model of the system based on real operation data. This is the aim of the advertised master thesis. During the master thesis various ML techniques could be applied on 1-year data (250msec resolution) and SOE estimation models could be developed and compared on real operation of the system.This research center is part of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers. With more than 42,000 employees and an annual budget of over € 5 billion, the Helmholtz Association is Germany’s largest scientific organisation"

Estimate the amount of solar panels that fit on a roof (computer vision):
Given a satellite picture and a ground image of a house, automatically detect certain elements of a roof (including obstacles, dormers etc.) in order to find out how many solar panels fit on it. This involves inferring 3d information from 2d pictures in order to infer the roof pitch.

Detect, classify and suggest legal effectiveness of text paragraphs (NLP):
Automatically go through thousands of legal documents with the goal to classify dedicated paragraphs and check their legal effectiveness. This involves converting scans to text, coming up with a labelling scheme (problem modeling), and detecting different paragraphs automatically, before tackling the inference task"
