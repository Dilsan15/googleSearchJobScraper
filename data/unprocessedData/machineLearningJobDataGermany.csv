In this context, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) supports young scientists through a specially established program, the Quantum Fellowship Program (QFP). With this research position, the DLR Microwaves and Radar Institute, with its world-renowned expertise in the design and development of Earth observation missions, offers anyone interested the opportunity to conduct research in an innovative research field within the framework of an industrial sponsorship.Our partner is the company HENSOLDT, an internationally leading supplier for defense and security electronics. The constellation of a large research institution and an industrial company gives the PhD student the unique opportunity to work in a team of DLR researchers and PhD students as well as with developers from industry and to gain... insight into the developments of quantum computing in a larger context. The PhD student will be encouraged to enter this dynamic field of research and to tackle the challenges of the following topic with creative ideas in collaboration with other PhD students, researchers and developers from different disciplines.Innovation drivers for modern radar systems, for example with applications for drone detection or for the automatic evaluation of large synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, are automatic target recognition algorithms.In the field of radar, the so-called micro-Doppler-based classification is state of the art. Here, the Doppler spectrum is analyzed for characteristic peculiarities (e.g. Doppler shifts induced by vibration or rotation of the object) to identify whether a radar signature is clutter, drone, bird, or similar. In particular, the radar backscatter cross-section of e.g. birds and drones is often similar in size, so that the Doppler signature is decisive. In combination with tracking, issues quickly arise, such as track-before-detect, or a more comprehensive approach that classifies the range-Doppler time cube as a whole. Here, algorithms on classical hardware quickly reach their limits, which is why quantum machine learning will be investigated to cope with the complexity and parameter optimization.The same applies to the requirements for automatic target recognition on SAR images. Increasingly larger sections are to be examined for more and more target classes. Furthermore, segmentation approaches for the subdivision of the scene into, for example, water, meadows, forest, urban areas, etc. are to be investigated. Again, quantum machine learning lends itself to meta-parameter optimization.The aim is firstly to build up expertise both in the field of automatic target recognition, quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning and their application in the context of automatic target recognition, and secondly to design, implement, simulate and test quantum algorithms also on quantum computers such as those of the companies D-Wave Systems and IBM.For this purpose, the following contents are to be addressed: literature, software and hardware research on the current state of analog, digital and hybrid quantum computing, especially in the field of quantum machine learning, taking into account the special requirements in the field of automatic target recognition study of relevant literature in the field of quantum computing as well as scientific publications and papers development of a sound understanding of the potentials and challenges in transferring radar signal processing algorithms for automatic target recognition to analog and digital quantum computers analyses of the use of innovative quantum processing techniques from the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. design, implementation, and testing of quantum algorithms for automatic target recognition on microdoppler spectra and SAR images (for example, exploiting quantum annealing) design of quantum machine learning algorithms for optimization of classical approaches and meta-parameter tuning supervision of master students in the field of Quantum Machine Learning for automatic target recognition documentation of results in the form of software and technical reports presentation of research results at national and international conferences and publication in scientific journals summarizing all relevant results into a dissertation

You want to combine state of the art machine learning and data science methods with real world sensor data to help reducing aviation’s climate impact? At the Multiphase Flows and Alternative Fuels Department of the DLR Institute of Combustion Technology we got the right mission for you!

At the DLR Institute of Combustion Technology, we span the bridge from fundamental to applied sciences on research topics related to combustion and fuel. About 100 employees from various scientific fields utilize modern experimental and computing facilities, and diagnostics and numerical methods, to design and optimize clean combustion systems and to asses and optimize sustainable fuels. In the department of Multiphase Flow and Alternative Fuels (MAT) in Stuttgart, you will conduct and initiate projects in the field of alternative fuels for aviation, road transport, and the energy sector. Your research work will contribute to reducing, now, our impact on the environment and the... climate.

In a team of about 10 scientists from Germany and abroad your research work ranges from the development of numerical methods and models, to the identification of promising fuel candidates using in-house computer codes and data science, to the coordination of flight tests aiming at characterizing the emissions of sustainable aviation fuels. One particular focus of the department is the holistic evaluation and optimization of fuels: fuel design. The aim is to explore possibilities for a climate-neutral use of fuels by means of digital methods. For this purpose, information and data must be collected and made available over the entire product life cycle. Since risk-related decisions are made on the basis of this information, uncertainties in data and models must be systematically recorded and evaluated. To facilitate this, a digital thread for representing process and information chains by means of digital twins for fuels shall be established within the scope of the position being advertised.

Within your mission, a hybrid sensor system for the fast online measurement of jet fuel properties (e.g. aromatic content, energy content) will be developed and its utilization at the airport and in fuel logistics will be demonstrated. This sensor system will combine sensor measurements and machine learning models and offers the potential to replace costly laboratory analytics. This could enable new potentials for reducing the climate impact of a flight mission, for example by adapting the flight routing to the available fuel or by optimized refueling strategies.

Your qualifications
• completed academic university degree (M. Sc. / university diploma) in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science or comparable subject
• fundamental knowledge in the fields of data science and machine learning
• advanced programming skills in Python
• good command of written and spoken English (scientific publication level)
• ability to work in a team as well as good communication skills
• ideally experience with sensors and measurement technology is a plus
• ideally experience with probabilistic machine learning using pyTorch/tensorflow/sklearn is a plus
• ideally first experience in collaborative code development (Git/GitLab)
• together with the MAT-Team you will develop a hybrid sensor system for the fast online characterization of jet fuel
• for this purpose, you train and analyze machine learning models for relevant jet fuel properties using a worldwide unique jet fuel database
• in collaboration with colleagues at the Institute, you identify suitable sensor hardware and commission it
• you demonstrate the hybrid sensor system for a selected real-world use case
• you analyze application scenarios for the hybrid sensor system at the airport and in fuel logistics within the framework of DLR-internal as well as publicly funded research projects
• you publish results in scientific publications as well as web-dashboards

Our Vision

We're creating a world where people feel accepted, satisfied, and fulfilled in their work, relationships, and company culture. Humane technology supports people finding and experiencing their bigger purpose.

We’re human-first. We focus on developing knowledge---not simply collecting data. Our decisions are human-centered, spanning from internal, to clients, and to the greater community. We build ethical and humane technology to make fair decisions, manifest accessibility, and create greater purpose. We do not create manipulative, automated environments that diminish the human. We do not create ""work drones"". We do not create inequality with our technology; it is ethically supervised. We create for the individual, not the machine.

Our Culture

In our house, we embrace giving people responsibility, allowing them to come up with---and implement---new ideas. To get things done, we work in a multicultural team. We accept and aim to understand those who are different from ourselves. We (almost) do not care which work environment you need to get things done (grind out code while listening to Sting on full-volume? Headphones, please:) ). What’s most important is getting our work done---and anticipating what comes next. We don’t celebrate ourselves all the time---even though we’re a cool bunch. Instead, we put our customers and the important work they do, first.

We love flexibility! We offer you the best environment to work in a flexible and focused way: You decide whether you want to work in our office in Cologne // Darmstadt // Düsseldorf while at the same time having the opportunity to work remotely (Germany). We want to offer you the most attractive workplace in e-commerce and a maximum of flexibility for your... personal work-life balance.

Day-by-day, our development team of about 250 experts pursues the goal of creating the best-possible customer shopping experience for the Kaufland.de marketplace.

• You consider yourself a craftsperson. You value quality, clean code, and solid (pun intended!) architecture patterns.
• You view making sense of other people’s code as a learning opportunity and are willing to dive into a bit of PHP/Go/Python or other languages to make small changes to our existing codebases so they become usable for your own services.
• A beginner’s level understanding of machine learning or experience in a data-centric team is required. Curiosity for the field is a big plus.
• You have a very high capacity for abstraction, a sound algorithmic understanding and are used to find your way around various data sources.
• You have excellent communication skills, are willing to embrace our company culture and values and enjoy working in an international, English-speaking team.

• Power meets dynamic - flat hierarchies and start-up mentality meet the power of a big corporate group and offers you an agile and secure working environment at the same time
• Free choice of hardware – we provide you with the development environment of your choice
• Personal & team growth: We love to have flexibility in terms of working location, but we also believe that personal interactions are important. That’s why we organize company events, and cover the costs to bring you there and to other (approved) get togethers with your peers. The same applies to conferences and other learning opportunities.

PhD - Increasing Robustness of Resource-Constrained Deep Learning Perception,NA,2023-01-30 12:21:37,https://www.google.com/search?q=Machine+Learning+Jobs+Germany&ibp=htl;jobs&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiJ7_LogfD8AhU0Ln0KHdF_AT0QutcGKAF6BAgREAU#htivrt=jobs&htidocid=doo24EV2AXcAAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D&fpstate=tldetail,Bosch Group,Full-time,NA,"Renningen, Germany","Company Description

At Bosch, we shape the future by inventing high-quality technologies and services that spark enthusiasm and enrich people’s lives. Our promise to our associates is rock-solid: we grow together, we enjoy our work, and we inspire each other. Join in and feel the difference.

The Robert Bosch GmbH is looking forward to your application!

Job Description

Deep learning is increasingly used for addressing perception problems such as, e.g., object detection, object tracking, or panoptic segmentation, in domains such as driver assistance/automated driving, robotics, or video surveillance. Two of the major challenges faced when deploying deep learning models under these conditions are:
• Due to real-time or privacy constraints, the deep learning model needs to run on the edge device. Resources consumption on edge devices must be relatively little, which puts hard or soft limits on quantities such as, e.g., latency and energy consumption.
• After deployment on the edge... device, the model will oftentimes face data unlike the typical data covered in its training data - there will be (continuous and/or sudden) domain shift and rare corner cases.

While each of these two challenges has been studied extensively in isolation, there is relatively little work that addresses both challenges at the same time. In contrast there is growing evidence that resource efficiency and robustness are at odds with each other: robustness to domain shift benefits largely from scaling models in terms of capacity and training data, while resource constraints prohibit exactly this scaling.

The goal of this thesis is to devise novel approaches for increasing robustness to domain shift under resource constraints. Possible directions for this are dynamic routing in neural networks, continual learning/test-time adaptation, or novel architectural building blocks for neural networks.

The PhD candidate will have the possibility to explore other directions that fall into the general framework of robust resource-constrained perception.

PhD candidates in our department will enjoy top quality inspiring research in an enthusiastic international environment of researchers in Bosch's Corporate Research. Networking with other PhD candidates, industrial professionals from Bosch, and exchanging with Bosch's academic partner network are an essential part of doing a PhD at Bosch.

Qualifications
• Education: excellent Master degree in Computer Science or related field
• Personality and working practice: a strong team player with a passion for tackling challenging problems, self-motivated with good communication skills
• Experience and knowledge: profound experience in deep learning, experience in applying deep learning to perception problems such as computer vision is a plus, strong background in algorithmics and/or mathematics, in-depth knowledge of contemporary machine learning methods and tools, proven programming skills in Python and experience in deep learning frameworks such as, e.g., TensorFlow/PyTorch/JAX, experience in writing scientific publications is a plus
• Languages: fluent in English (written and spoken), academic writing skills are a plus

PhD position available for Topology Optimization and Machine Learning for the Design of Multicomponent Struc-tures with Application in Robotics.

24.01.2023, Wissenschaftliches Personal

We are offering a full-time position in our lab in Garching/Munich as Research & Teaching Assistant (m/f/d) for Topology optimization and machine learning for the design of multi-component structures with applications in robotics (PhD)

The Laboratory for Product Development and Lightweight Design focuses on the design and optimization of complex technical systems. We develop methods, tools and specific solutions to technical problems with optimal functionality, weight and cost. We are currently looking for a research/teaching assistant to design multi-component structures with topology optimization and machine learning.

Topic
When designing mechanical structures, known forms such as e.g. standard profiles, are... used. This supports manufacturability and low costs, but at the same time limits optimality in terms of weight and function. In contrast, so-called top-down approaches aim at technical solutions whose components are defined as little as possible in advance. An optimal, previously unknown form of mechanical structures can be determined via topology optimiza-tion purely according to functional criteria or weight. Specially trained machine learning algorithms serve as estima-tors for manufacturability, costs and weight. These methods are used in several projects, e.g., in the design of new lightweight structures for robots.

Tasks
• Develop methods and algorithms for optimization (especially topology optimization) and machine learning for the design of lightweight structures
• Contribute to lab team projects
• Support lectures and lab exercises and supervise students

Required (please explain in the cover letter)
• Master’s degree in mechanical engineering, automotive engineering, aerospace engineering or similar
• Solid knowledge of technical mechanics, numerical optimization and machine learning
• Fluent in German or strong commitment to learning German

We offer
• Innovative topic, interdisciplinary team, possibility to graduate with a PhD degree, stay abroad
• Full position as research/teaching assistant (m/w/d) with salary according to TV-L

Application
All applications received by 05.02.2023 will be considered. Please send your application (reference code TopOpt) by email to: applications.lpl@ed.tum.de. Please visit our website to check for extensions of the deadline.

Disabled people are given preference if they are equally suitable and qualified. TUM promotes equality between women and men.

Healthcare workers speak freely and our AI automatically generates the correct structured forms.

We are YC-funded and grow quickly. Our customers like Caritas, Contilia, and TÜV NORD create thousands of documentation records every single day.

Today speech recognition is primarily used as a fun gimmick for consumers, who set kitchen timers with their Alexa speaker.

We build a completely new class of speech-powered applications, to supercharge the professional workforce. By focusing on individual workflows like healthcare or vehicle inspections, we create truly magical user experiences and save each user 30 minutes per day in administrative work.

Don’t believe it? See for yourself in our 3-minute product demo ( https : / / youtu.be / AlkVD4OwCQk ).

The entire system is built in-house, giving us full control over the user... experience, product design, NLP models, and speech recognition.

Our custom speech recognition models already outperform Google with 10x lower error rates and we are just getting started!

If you ever wanted to work at the bleeding edge of product design, applied machine learning research, and MLOps, you should apply.

You get to build products with daily user feedback, train AI models on real-world data, and ship to production on a daily basis.

At voize new software is deployed to production every 5h on average! We deploy new AI models every 24h and have one of the largest speech data sets for medical documentation.

Interview Process

To help us determine that we are both a great fit for each other and are happy to change the world together for years to come, we run a 4 stage interview process.

This process is usually completed in 2-3 weeks.

This is a more informal video call with you and one of our founders, to get to know you, and share more details on the role.

Together we want to determine if this role is a great fit for you and get a basic understanding of your personal interests and technical & soft skills.

2. Technical Interview with CTO (Remote) :

In this video call, we want to learn more about your technical skills and past projects you have worked on.

The best way to impress us is by showing us a project you’ve built and walking us through the 2 hardest technical / design decisions you had to make.

Mostly, we want to know that you can code and ship fairly involved systems, and speak to them with clarity on the details.

This tends to be a good indication that an engineer had strong ownership and showed autonomy in making a product or technical decisions.

3. Pair Programming Challenge (Remote) :

At this stage, we want to show you the kind of challenges we are facing on a daily basis. In a pair programming setting, you will get access to a portion of our system and will debug an Error we’ve introduced or build a prototype of a new feature.

4. Onboarding

If you and our team both see a great culture and technical fit, we will send you a job offer and walk you through our onboarding process.

In your first week, you will ship your very own first feature to production! We will prepare a great first task, help you along the way and celebrate the release and direct user feedback.

It provides a non-invasive and non-destructive method for examining a wide range of samples, for example, to find out the composition of SARS-CoV-2 at an atomic level. The outcome of such NMR measurements is often a spectrum, which precisely describes the content of the examined sample. Deep learning methods are currently utilized to process the spectrum and extract features. However, the spectra are often of high dimensions, and thus, the computational demands for processing them are high. Luckily, spectra contain unimportant information like noise, and a small set of variables can often describe the critical features. Your task: You will use deep learning techniques to compress spectra into a set of descriptive... features that are enough to reconstruct the spectrum from them. Specifically, autoencoders (or encoder-decoder networks) are a promising approach: The encoder compresses the input to a small latent representation, and the decoder can reconstruct the input given this latent space. Your task includes finding the most suitable autoencoder structure (e.g. VAE) to compress NMR spectra, and to implement a functioning pipeline in pytorch (or similar).You will be part of Prof. Korvink’s research group where you can get support from members with expertise in NMR theory, methodology, hardware, and simulation.This research center is part of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers.

Research aims at developing novel system architectures, i.e. considering the interaction of all elements in this system of systems. In this way, the DLR Institute is working to establish the future paradigm for the design and optimization of products and systems. Using this, innovative aircraft systems can be realized in a time- and cost-efficient manner.For this purpose, digital design methods such as Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) are increasingly applied. This development is made possible by holistic approaches to modeling the product and operating environment, which are accompanied by a steady increase... in digital models and data along the entire product life cycle. The handling of these very large amounts of data, respectively their evaluation and especially the derivation of knowledge for the design of improved products represents a central challenge in today’s product development processes. A promising approach to make interdependencies in the ever-growing design space tangible and usable is found in the application of machine learning (ML) methods, whose rapid development has produced a variety of possibilities for knowledge inference based on large data sets in recent years. In addition to the increasing understanding of dependencies in the higher-level design space, there is the possibility of generating knowledge fragments for generative product design based on Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) techniques. Enabling this capability enlarges the potential to obtain even better products by effectively evaluating and including previously unused data in the design process.Therefore, we are looking for a new employee, having PhD aspirations, focusing on the identification of which ML methods are most suited for knowledge inference along the entire design process and to work out how these can be made accessible in the design process for the design of future complex system architectures in aviation in a user-oriented way.Your main tasks will be: development of methodological competences in the field of machine learning (ML) identification of existing data/data sets along the entire aviation system, as well as their classification with regard to their suitability for knowledge inference development and user-oriented provision of software to support data exploration and knowledge inference using ML methods

These technologies allow efficient 3D reconstruction of cultural heritage and industry objects. Multiple criteria must be evaluated to construct precise 3D models in reproducible and standardized quality. These evaluations can take a lot of time and can be accelerated using machine learning.

What you will do

The main task is to develop and train different methods to optimize and speed up intermediate reconstructed 3D models that are used during scanning. Different kinds of datasets must be generated for training and evaluation by using tools e.g. Blender. These machine learning methods must be modified for computations on a GPU cluster. Finally, there are hands-on tests with the corresponding 3D scanner.

In addition, stable metrics that provide sufficient information about the quality of the... reconstructed 3D model should be developed. The goal is to use these metrics already during the scanning process as preliminary information to predict better scanning positions. This will implicitly lead to an increase in the overall accuracy of the final, reconstructed 3D model, and thus improve the performance of the entire scanning system"
