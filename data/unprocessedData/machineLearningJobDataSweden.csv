There are many consumer facing fintech products, but finance as a whole is virtually untouched by technology. Investment decisions are still being made out of pdf’s and “shark tank”-like processes rather than utilising the forecasting methods found at companies like Spotify or Google. This makes capital allocation riddled with bias and very ripe for disruption.

At ArK we’re convinced that by putting data and tech at the heart of finance we can impact how money flows and, in turn, create a more democratised and unbiased economy.

Today we offer founders access to our machine learning platform AIM. Through connecting their raw data we can fully understand what they’ve built without any bias; connecting what has been achieved historically into a simulated 5-year future. This prediction is the foundation for the transformational loans that we are able to issue, and a tool that founders get to keep for business optimisation.

AiM is using big data and machine learning to... analyse and predict companies’ current and future performance, to be used as a foundation for our frontier credit decision making. All in all, we thrive in the win-win data modelling where insights are valuable both for ArK as a lender, but also for our customer as a growth company. We build AiM to push beyond “credit scoring”, and to become the unrivalled place to plug in your company data, and get back valuable insights for optimising company growth — when our customers grow efficiently, everybody wins.

Being an ML leader at ArK

ArK has one of the most diverse sets of company data in the world, and it is growing at an incredible pace. The diversity and richness of data we want you to work with is essentially unheard of as we get raw data directly from our customers’ IT systems, and we want your help to make sense of it, both for us, and for our customers. The challenges here are unlike anywhere else as we’re striving to build generalizable modelling solutions that can be applied across an incredibly broad range of company data and business models.

Some of the problems that we help our customers solve are figuring out really detailed customer lifetime values (e.g. placing a value on our customers’ customers) and projecting their future revenue and cost growth — which conveniently enough is excellent data to base lending decisions on and tailor financing solutions to.

We’re also exploring advanced user churn modelling, credit scoring, customer business clustering and performance benchmarking and various clustering techniques to better understand businesses and their customers. As a leader at ArK we want you to help us define what’s possible and work on what’s valuable.

At ArK you will be a part of our tech and analytics teams and work with data engineers, data scientists, UX designers, data analysts and other ML professionals — bringing your unique skills to the table.

You are …
• … Someone who wants to lead and run Machine Learning projects from data crunching and prototyping — to quality assured models that run in a production environment.
• … Knowledgeable in the inner workings of the models you apply, and how to construct and optimise for suitable loss functions — and other similar concepts
• … Driven by impact and can deliver business value from projects fast, and then iterate over time to increase that value further
• … Interested both in the modelling and the engineering aspects of building good ML that works reliably
• … A future or current leader in the space who stays up to date and are not afraid to deploy modern techniques, and mentor and knowledge share with colleagues

Nice-to-have
• Experience from a product centric company
• Product and/or people leadership/management experience
• Experience writing blogs or articles, we really want to give back to the community and share our work and findings

More about who we are at ArK

ArK was founded in 2021 by a six-time entrepreneur, a world-class AI technology developer and a veteran banker. Since then we’ve carefully grown our team to 30 - all pitching in with their experience to build something that none of us has seen before.

We believe that the key to a great team culture is great people having a great time together. Our team is one to be part of for the long run, because you won’t want to leave. Our unique combination of startup mentality, experienced team and ambitious vision make ample room for possibilities to grow.

Job Description:

AI/ML Research Engineer Internship

Your role within our Kingdom

In recent years, self- supervised transformer models have advanced the state- of- the- art performance on a wide range of supervised tasks. Variations of encoder- based models pre- trained for self- supervised tasks like masked input modeling have been applied successfully for text (), image (), sound () and tabular (, ) data domains. This pre- training stage builds a robust understanding of how features relate to each other without needing labeling and allows for higher performance on downstream tasks. The primary objective of this project is to investigate how to leverage self- supervised transformer- based models to make more use of the tabular data King already has available. This could lower the barrier to entry for new machine learning applications, lower re- training costs and possibly increase performance in already established downstream tasks. Here at King we... care deeply about player experience. We believe that this project will help us to understand our players better and improve their experience.

This is a 4- 6 months ML research internship in our AI Labs team at the AI Center of Excellence in King. You will be part of a team and work together with other machine learning (research) engineers and data scientists. In addition, you have the opportunity of working closely with our special project teams, ML platform teams and experts in the game team. As an intern, you will learn about real world applications of machine learning working with game domain experts, as well as challenges of working with real- world data, and get to work with machine learning production systems. At the end of this internship, we expect to publish the results of the research in a scientific conference or journal.

Start date: We are ready to start the project, however, we would like to optimize for the right person to join the team So, we can work together on a starting date :)

Internship Location:
Since the team is based in Stockholm, we prefer the intern to be also based in Sweden but we are open to consider candidates from countries where we have offices including UK, Spain, and Germany.

Required materials to apply:
Please share with us (1) your CV, (2) a short description on your PhD topic and your relevant experience with transformer based models and (3) contact of an academic reference. Collect this material in one single PDF document and attach it to your application.

Skills to create thrills
You are a PhD student working in the field of computer science, machine learning, robotics, natural language processing, or similar. Recent PhD graduates with relevant background are welcomed to apply. You have research experience on transformers in your academic project. You have a passion for the topic and putting your ML skills to work in practice. You are interested in reading research methodologies and implementing them. You are interested in data exploration. You have strong programming skills in python. You have experience in working with Pytorch, Tensorflow, or Keras. You care about code quality and are familiar with software development best practices. You can demonstrate strong communication skills.

General Summary:

Are you interested in making the roads safer with proactive safety features and autonomous driving in cars using computer vision and machine learning? We continue to expand our newly established office in Lund and are looking for senior developers with a passion for software product development and most importantly a team mindset.

Qualcomm is the American multinational corporation known for its semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. It also focuses on the automotive industry and has become a major hardware and software provider empowering the digital transformation within this area. We belong to the automotive branch at Qualcomm, who deliver the Snapdragon Digital Chassis. It is a set of cloud-connected platforms for telematics and connectivity, the digital cockpit and driver assistance and autonomy for vehicles.

One part of the... Digital Chassis is the Snapdragon Ride Platform, which includes the advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving (AD) functionality built around low-power, high-performance system on a chip (SoC) platforms, flexible vision solutions and an SDK for simulation and continuous learning.

The Snapdragon Ride Platform and SDK are supporting automakers to build cars that are connected to networks, the cloud, other cars, pedestrians, traffic, and infrastructure systems. The Snapdragon Ride Platform is at the forefront of the intelligent and connected automotive transformation, gaining momentum with global automakers and Tier 1 suppliers worldwide. Collaborations include OEMs like BMW and Cadillac — luxury automotive companies poised to lead the intelligently connected automotive revolution.

Who we are 

Qualcomm recently acquired Arriver, a new Swedish software company originating from Autoliv, that is fully focused on developing vision perception and drive policy software for the next generation advanced driver assist and autonomous driving systems in vehicles. The perception functionality will be shipped in the Qualcomm Snap Dragon Ride as part of the Digital Chassis Platforms.

We are situated across three continents, USA, Europe and Asia. In Sweden, we employ more than 500 in mainly four cities - Linköping, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Lund. 

Having a global presence and diverse workforce, means that we mostly communicate in English and also that our music quizzes have a rich cultural variety. 

  

We are now ramping up the development of our fifth-generation vision perception and driver policy platform. The platform has already had commercial success with a major German vehicle manufacturer sourcing it for upcoming luxury vehicles. The platform will include solutions for the next generation advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) with the goal of being the global market leader.

At our new development site in Lund, we are organized in cross-functional agile teams consisting of 5-8 members developing functions both for ground truth generation and in-car perception functions. While each team member contributes with their own skills and experience, the team cooperates to perform all parts of the development lifecycle. In close collaboration with different stakeholders, new software and algorithms are developed to full-fill functional specifications and the definition of done.

Our teams innovate at the frontiers of engineering using technologies such as machine learning, tracking and 3D reconstruction.

We continue to strengthen our teams in order to scale up data and machine learning pipelines, automatic ground truth generation and vision perception to secure a successful platform delivery and strive towards creating a world where everyone arrives safe and sound at their destination. 

Who are you? 

We are neither searching for a ninja evangelist or any other buzzword, nor are we looking for someone that needs to tick all the boxes in a long list of programming languages. What we do look for are senior developers who already know how to take an idea and concept and make it into a real deployable feature with the right quality.

You are used to working in an agile iterative development process with backlogs and sprints, doing continuous refinements, breaking down epics into achievable stories and performing retrospectives to grow and learn both as individual and team. You know how to perform and support software releases and can if needed tackle late incoming change requests to reach desired goals.

We think that you like to:

• Write code in Python and C/C+• Use fundamental software architecture concepts and patterns

• Perform data manipulation, transformation and processing

• Train and deploy modern machine learning models

• Develop new algorithms and methods within computer vision

• Coach team members in best practices in software development

• Be a curios and lean team player willing to grow and share knowledge

To be successful, we also think you have a solid theoretical background in the form of a Master of Science or PhD in machine learning, image- or signal processing, computer science or equivalent area.

We offer 

A workplace where you contribute to the development of cutting-edge technology that aims to enhance road safety. Our flexible work hours and generous health and fitness reimbursements support our employees to work at their best capacity at all times. Being a small office in a large organization provides the best of both worlds; stability of the large cooperation as well as the possibility to contribute with your unique touch to our local company culture and activities.  

Additionally, Qualcomm supports part-time remote work. With us you will be surrounded by inspiring and sharp colleagues who like what we do and have fun at work. Additionally, you have the opportunity to grow and develop yourself and your skills while having the chance to work with something meaningful.

  

Apply! 

We very much look forward to your application! Even if you plan to relocate or change jobs at a later time, you are welcome to send in your application now. 

And since we will have continuous selection, and places can be filled before the last application date, please don’t wait with submitting your application.

Then you’ve come to the right place!

Who are we?

Univrses is a 3D Computer Vision and Machine Learning company, creating high-end technologies for autonomous systems. Our main focus is on smart cities and self-driving vehicles. The Company is based in Stockholm, Sweden, but we work with clients all over the world. Our team now consists of 50 hard-working and friendly people, all working in our bright and spacious facilities by Medborgarplatsen in the heart of Södermalm, Stockholm. We are constantly expanding due to the increasing demand for high-quality technologies in 3D perception and mapping. And that’s where you come in!
Master Thesis at Univrses

Right now, we offer Master students the opportunity to be an integral part of the team while working on their Thesis. You will be working in a fun, stimulating and highly professional work environment together with our... awesome team. This is truly a unique chance to work with some of the best scientists and engineers in Computer Vision and Robotics in the world.

The projects: Multi-modal learning meets Domain Adaptation

Cross-city domain shift is the cause of a 25-30% accuracy drop in normal Deep Learning predictors. Changes in weather and lighting conditions might even result in more disruptive effects. The cause of this disruption lies in a gap between the training and deployment domain, we refer to this concept as “domain shift”. Therefore, to provide a robust and accurate output, the predictor would need to be trained on every possible deployment condition, e.g. multiple cities, districts, seasons, kinds of weather, cameras pose and camera intrinsics. This vastly reduces AI solutions' scalability in terms of costs and deployment time. Self-supervised learning Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods proved to be very effective in mitigating (or even solving) these shortcomings. Univrses has been active for several years in the research of UDA methods in Vision Deep Learning, in the form of MSc theses, internal investigations and published conference papers.

Recently, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) achieved astonishing results, managing to learn from unstructured and unlabelled data with performances competitive to fully supervised methods. Such sharp improvements are shaking the foundations of Deep Learning as we know it.

Several deep learning long-sought goals now seem within’s arm's reach, e.g. open set classification and adaptation, continuously adaptive systems, and multimodal learning with scarce annotations. With the advent of CLIP and other SSL and Online Adaption techniques, we’re seeing the dawn of a new Deep Learning era, where we’re moving away from fixed semantics, fixed datasets and fixed objectives.

Goals

The goal of this project is to leverage the recent advancement in SSL and multimodal learning to find new ways to tackle domain adaptation. This means for you to:
• Perform an extensive literature review on Vision UDA and SSL methods.
• Identify creative and challenging research gaps.
• Design, develop and benchmark your methods.
• Discuss with tech teams how to integrate your results into real products.
• Bonus: Submit your results to top-tier Deep Learning conferences.

Wireless communication is one of the most dynamic areas which has seen great technological leaps starting from 2G all the way to today’s buzzword 5G. Many new use cases of communications are emerging to drive the 5G and beyond technologies such as massive Internet-of-Things (IoT), ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) and ever evolving enhanced mobile broadband (EMBB). All these novel applications have challenging requirements such as serving high-density of users/devices simultaneously, increased rates per device and reduced latency for mission critical applications. Beam-forming is a powerful technique to boost the desired signal towards intended users while suppressing harmful interference and thereby helpful in addressing above challenges. However, traditional linear iterative algorithms for beamforming may have significant disadvantage in terms of robustness against channel state information error, computational complexity and/or latency when... dealing with increasing number of antennas and/or cooperating base-stations in 5G networks. Therefore, there is a great interest towards machine learning (ML) based approaches for designing the downlink beamforming which can be trained efficiently (e.g. offline unsupervised), achieving better performance vs complexity trade-offs and have mechanisms for adapting to dynamic channel conditions and/or scenarios. In this respect, the goals of this project are as follows:
• Goal 1: Literature review of existing ML-approaches for 5G beam-forming
• Goal 2: Implementing the training and testing of chosen ML-approaches in Python environment
• Goal 3: Performance comparison of studied ML-approaches with traditional algorithms

The positions are situated within the research project Observatory of Poverty, situated in the AI and Global Development Lab (you will find more information about the Lab at www.global-lab.ai), funded by the Swedish Research Council (SRC). The Lab furthers the use of AI for Social Good for the sustainable development goals.Project descriptionAbout 900 million people—one-third in Africa—live in extreme poverty. Operating on the assumption that life in impoverished communities is fundamentally so different that it can trap people in cycles of deprivation (‘poverty traps’), major development agencies have deployed a stream of development projects to break these cycles (‘poverty targeting’). However, scholars are currently unable to answer questions such as in what capacity do poverty traps exist; to what extent do these... interventions release communities from such traps—as they are held back by a data challenges. This challenge is that there is a lack of geo-temporal poverty data, and thus, one of the goals of the Observatory of Poverty project is to develop new methods to produce such data. Thus, this is the main challenge that the postdoc is expected to contribute to.1.To train learning algorithms to estimate poverty from satellite images, of African communities over time and space, quarterly, from 1984 to 2020.2.To contribute to creating a statistical package—ObservatoryOfPoverty—that enables us, and other scholars, to produce poverty estimates for policy evaluation.Another goal of the Observatory of Poverty is to use our poverty estimates to identify to what extent African communities are trapped in poverty and explain how competing aid and development interventions alter these communities’ prospects to free themselves from deprivation. This goal is about causal inference. Thus, a secondary goal of the postdoc position is to facilitate the methodological development for causal inference for the project.In other words, we are searching for a candidate that is interested in either poverty estimation from satellite images or the causal inference part of the project, or both. Your interest should be clearly stated in your application and linked to your track-record.The candidate for the postdoc position will join the AI and Global Development Lab and is expected to produce research that contributes to the listed objectives or related spin-off objectives (e.g., based on the candidate’s research interest).
