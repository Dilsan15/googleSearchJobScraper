AI/ML Engineer - Sequence Learning

At GSK we see a world in which advanced applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) will allow us to develop novel therapies to existing diseases and to quickly respond to emerging or changing diseases with personalized drugs, driving better outcomes at reduced cost with fewer side effects. It is an ambitious vision that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of AI/ML. If that excites you, we'd love to chat.

The AI/ML Sequence Learning Team applies machine learning and AI methods to biological sequence (DNA, RNA, protein) data from large-scale human genetic, functional genomic and single cell experiments. Models operating directly on sequence data that can infer how variants alter protein/RNA abundance, structure and function have the potential to be transformative in drug discovery, empowering us to find new life saving... medicines.

We're looking for a highly accomplished AI/ML Engineer to help us make this vision a reality. Competitive candidates will have a track record of shipping high performing AI/ML powered products in production environments. They are highly accomplished Machine Learning Engineers, with breadth across machine learning methods, as well as depth in at least one area. Additionally, they are accomplished software engineers with a track record of shipping stable, tested, performant code and services in an agile environment.

Strong candidates will have graduate studies in computer science, applied mathematics, or the equivalent, and a passion for solving challenging problems in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Educational or professional background in the biological sciences is a plus; passion to help therapies for new and existing diseases, and a pattern of continuous learning and development is mandatory.

The AI/ML team is built on the principles of ownership, accountability, continuous development, and collaboration. We hire for the long term, and we're motivated to make this a great place to work. Our leaders will be committed to your career and development from day one.

We're combining the power of genetic and genomic insights into what causes disease, with the speed and scale of AI/ML to make better predictions about who a treatment might work for, and why. We believe this powerful combination of data and technology holds the key to fundamentally transforming medical discovery for the better, improving R&D success rates and shaping how even the most challenging diseases, like neurological conditions and cancer, can be both prevented and treated.

In 2021 we delivered four major product approvals: Cabenuva for HIV, Jemperli for endometrial cancer, Xevudy for COVID-19 and Apretude, our new long-acting medicine for HIV prevention.

Our approach to R&D

In this role you will
• Use your expertise in machine learning, software engineering and genomics to deliver AI/ML-powered services and libraries
• Work closely with subject matter experts in human genetics to conceive, plan and execute novel AI/ML solutions to key drug discovery problems
• Leverage the expertise of more senior team mates to continuously develop understanding of scientific, machine learning and software engineering best practice in the organisation, to construct robust, tested, production-grade software products with well-characterised performance and limitations
• Fully participate in the scientific and engineering culture of the Sequence Learning Team, as a code reviewer and collaborator
• Continuously develop expertise in a fast-moving and intellectually challenging (but highly rewarding!) scientific space
• Exhibit excellent self-management and communication skills, taking full ownership and working transparently to deliver objectives to specification and on time

Hypermile is on a mission to improve trucking efficiency, sustainability and safety by developing an AI driver assistance system . Today, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for >1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions.

In addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes.

With this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. Our product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel:

anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. The company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M

We build, deploy and operate AI solutions to increase our customers' performance and help them realise their full potential. We believe that AI should be trustworthy, impactful and beneficial across society. Those principles have shaped our work with more than 230 organisations across the public and private sectors as we help them use AI to understand more deeply, make better decisions and act faster.

To give an example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we built the COVID-19 Early Warning System to forecast hospital admissions and life-saving equipment up to three weeks in advance. The ground-breaking tool helped frontline workers at the NHS save lives. We also work with the Home Office on Counter-Terrorism initiatives - Faculty built an AI model that automatically detects both new and existing propaganda videos and stops them from being uploaded.

What You'll Be Doing

You will design, build, and deploy... production-grade software, infrastructure, and MLOps systems that leverage machine learning to help our customers solve high-impact problems.

You are engineering-focused, with a keen interest and working knowledge of operationalised machine learning. You have a desire to take cutting edge ML applications into the real world. You will develop new methodologies and champion best practices for managing AI systems deployed at scale, with regard to technical, ethical and practical requirements. You will support both technical and non-technical stakeholders to deploy ML to solve real-world problems. To enable this, we work in cross-functional teams with representation from commercial, data science, product management and design specialities to cover all aspects of AI product delivery.

The Machine Learning Engineering team is responsible for the engineering aspects of our customer delivery projects. As a Machine Learning Engineer, you'll be essential to helping us achieve that goal by:
• Building software and infrastructure that leverages Machine Learning;
• Creating reusable, scalable tools to enable better delivery of ML systems
• Working with our customers to help understand their needs
• Working with data scientists and engineers to develop best practices and new technologies; and
• Implementing and developing Faculty's view on what it means to operationalise ML software.

We're a rapidly growing organisation, so roles are dynamic and subject to change. Your role will evolve alongside business needs, but you can expect your key responsibilities to include:
• Working in cross-functional teams of engineers, data scientists, designers and managers to deliver technically sophisticated, high-impact systems.
• Working with senior engineers to scope projects and design systems
• Providing technical expertise to our customers
• Technical Delivery

Requirements

Who We're Looking For

We like people who combine expertise and ambition with optimism -- who are interested in changing the world for the better -- and have the drive and intelligence to make it happen. If you're the right candidate for us, you probably:
• Think scientifically, even if you're not a scientist - you test assumptions, seek evidence and are always looking for opportunities to improve the way we do things.
• Love finding new ways to solve old problems - when it comes to your work and your professional development, you don't believe in ‘good enough'. You always seek new ways to solve old challenges.
• Are pragmatic and outcome-focused - you know how to balance the big picture with the little details and know a great idea is useless if it can't be executed in the real world.

To succeed in this role, you'll need the following -- these are illustrative requirements and we don't expect all applicants to have experience in all these (70% is a rough guide) :
• Understanding of and interest in the full machine learning lifecycle, including deploying trained machine learning models developed using common frameworks such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
• Understanding of the core concepts of probability and statistics and familiarity with common supervised and unsupervised learning techniques
• Experience in software engineering which ideally would include programming in Python.
• Technical experience of cloud architecture, security, deployment, and open-source tools. Hands-on experience required of at least one major cloud platform
• Demonstrable experience with containers and specifically Docker and Kubernetes
• Comfortable in a high-growth startup environment.
• Outstanding verbal and written communication.
• Excitement about working in a dynamic role with the autonomy and freedom you need to take ownership of problems and see them through to execution

Benefits

What we can offer you

The Faculty team is diverse and distinctive, and we all come from different personal, professional and organisational backgrounds. We all have one thing in common: we are driven by a deep intellectual curiosity that powers us forward each day. This curiosity pushes us to seek truth and understanding in everything we do, to execute work in a nimble and pragmatic manner, to foster talent in one another and always to challenge assumptions.

Faculty is the professional challenge of a lifetime. You'll be surrounded by an impressive group of brilliant minds working to advance our goal of making artificial intelligence real. Our consultants, product developers, business development specialists, operations professionals and more all bring something unique to Faculty, and you'll learn something new from everyone you meet. You'll also have the opportunity to make your mark on a high-growth start-up now poised to expand internationally.

Fostering talent is one of our core values, it's built into our culture and what we offer. Faculty was founded by people who are passionate about continuous learning, and adding value to our people.

Some of our benefits.....
• Genuinely flexible working: We believe people have needs, responsibilities and interests that require something different to a strict working day. We trust people to organise and take accountability for their own work and do our best to support their lives outside Faculty. We provide you with all you need to work from home, including a laptop, keyboard, chair...even Sony headphones!
• Equity, we want you to benefit from Faculty's growth and success.
• Unlimited holidays: We encourage each other to use this time to take a break, work on personal projects, or to spend time with their friends and family.
• Fantastic private health, optical and dental cover, for you & your family - including 24/7 unlimited virtual private GP appointments and covering pre-existing medical conditions.
• Access to mental health coaching with Sanctus
• Breakfast & Lunch daily, and more fruit, drinks and snacks than you could ever eat (for office-based employees).

Our mission is to automate a 150-year-old legal process of due diligence, enabling anyone involved in a property transaction to properly understand what they are getting into, from the outset, before incurring legal fees.

Orbital Witness is an award-winning LegalTech-meets-PropTech start-up focused on simplifying and accelerating the legal process in property transactions. We’ve already saved over 130,000 hours of time - equivalent to over £50m in legal fees and we’ve only just begun! We experienced rapid growth during the pandemic as lawyers moved online and we’re looking to accelerate even further. We know how critically important early hires are, and we’re intentionally assembling a world-class team.

We are backed by legendary early stage venture capital funds in Europe (including LocalGlobe and Seedcamp who have invested in tech unicorns Zoopla, Transferwise and UIpath) and some of the world’s largest real estate companies and financial institutions (JLL, Starwood... Capital and Investec). https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/orbital-witness

We value diversity at Orbital Witness, and would particularly encourage applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech. We’d love to hear from you even if you don’t match all of the criteria outlined.

Overview of the role

We've launched a new product which is delivering much needed transparency to the home buying process, with a view to transform the way property is transacted.

We are looking for an experienced Product Manager who has worked on and led the development of machine learning based products in the past. We want this person to deeply understand the interplay between engineering, data science and domain experts who translate the domain into labelled data that is ultimately used to train models which are the foundation of our product. You’ll be taking over product management responsibilities from both the co-founder and CTO who have been sharing this workload for the past year. The team is currently composed of a Tech Lead (engineering), Head of Data Science, Data Scientist, Head of Legal Engineering, Legal Engineer and a paralegal data labeller and we’re actively hiring across more roles for this team.

You’ll get the chance to:
• Own the detailed product strategy of our new residential conveyancing product, reporting directly to the CTO, so we improve product-market fit and ultimately enable significant revenue growth #BoldAndAmbitious
• Set quarterly OKRs and weekly KPIs so the team is relentlessly focused on the most important thing #EatThatFrog
• Attend customer calls and visit customer offices around the UK to better understand use cases and gather customer feedback so it can be turned into requirements for the team to develop
• Relentlessly prioritise a roadmap and keep it up-to-date so that it can be shared at a high-level with the leadership and business development teams, as well as at a low-level so the team knows exactly what to work on next and for months into the future
• Manage feature development, bug fixing, automated testing, system maintenance and overall support for the product as we rapidly iterate on it for customers
• Use technology to improve both the quantity and quality of what we are currently delivering to customers. At the moment, our delivery team (made up of paralegals and conveyancers) are using a partially manual methodology, enhanced by some existing tooling
• Lead a team full of highly competent and driven engineers, data scientists and legal engineers
• Identify talent gaps in the team and have a significant input into the hiring plan so we achieve our goals

You should apply if:
• You’re an experienced Product Manager who has previously built machine learning products and understands the importance of both the quality and quantity of labelled data for the overall success of a product
• You’re incredibly driven and want the opportunity to lead a significant part of Orbital Witness’s future growth. You also want to be held accountable for driving growth and will personally champion the setting up, sticking to and achieving of quarterly targets
• You are not intimidated by and enjoy context switching between deeply technical architecture / data science problems, learning a very specific domain language and its translation into labelled data, as well as high-level stakeholder management around business outcomes and revenue growth. You can assimilate all this information into a concise and easy to understand roadmap that the team and the wider business believes in
• You foster healthy debate within the team so the right outcome is achieved not just an outcome. You should have a “strong opinions weakly held” mentality so that you can lead the team effectively but also change your opinion when it’s wrong #QuestionOrCommit
• You feel very comfortable spending hours in Google Docs, Jira (or a similar ticket management system) and Metabase (or similar analytics tools) where you’ll write clear requirements, prioritise work, respond to comments from team members and glean insights from metrics dashboards (ideally you might also know some SQL)
• You get how Kanban works and know first hand how it empowers a team to move quickly and iteratively while managing stakeholders expectations for deadlines and timeframes. You also have no problem talking about continuous delivery, lead time, cycle time and WIP limits.
• You enjoy making adjustments to the delivery process of shipping code into production so the team is hyper efficient. You also clearly understand the trade-offs involved with building a product that is accurate and high product versus speed of execution.
• A fun and collaborative team environment. We don’t do egos.
• We benchmark to provide competitive salaries, matched pension contributions and equity options.
• Flexible working hours and location; you can choose to work from home or from our HQ in Central London (as well access to 40+ TOG spaces across London)
• 25 days paid holiday (plus bank holidays).
• Professional equipment and a £1,000 p/a personal learning and development budget.
• Training opportunities to develop both your technical abilities and soft skills.
• Free access to the Spill Mental Health Support platform (we believe in looking after ourselves, mind and body).
• Cycle-to-work scheme.
• Generous parental leave policy
• An inclusive community of colleagues where we can all enjoy all-company off-sites, lunches and team socials"

Hybrid - 2-3 days in London (Southwark)

Salary - £75,000 - £85,000
Who we are

Carbon Re is an AI research and development company dedicated to reducing gigatonnes of CO2 from humanity’s emissions each year. We are focused on the energy intensive manufacturing industries; cement, steel, glass, etc., which are responsible for approximately 20% of global emissions and are referred to as ‘hard-to-abate industries’ for which there is currently no viable path to decarbonisation. Our mission is to develop Machine Learning products and solutions that can enable rapid decarbonisation of these industries. Initially this will involve improving and optimising the current manufacturing process but in the long term we aim to rethink and redesign these manufacturing systems for net-zero and accelerate the development of new climate-friendly materials and processes.

About this role

As an experienced engineer in our Machine Learning team, you will lead the improvement of our... recommendation engine by improving our models and developing better optimisation systems. You will mainly work with time-series physical / chemical data, focusing on building and evaluating deep learning models in these contexts. Your goal will be to develop better and more performant models, and to improve our internal understanding of our growing datasets. You will be primarily work in our shared codebase, using PyTorch as your daily driver.

As a senior engineer, you will take a a crucial role in the development of our product, mentoring other team members and improving our internal processes to obtain a multiplier impact across the organisation. You will have a key part in defining your role and day-to-day work.

You will be responsible for the design of solid, maintainable, and scalable architectures, managing competing requirements and deadlines in an early startup environment, and help set strategic priorities to deliver on our ambitious long-term vision for products and solutions that have a significant impact on carbon emissions and drive the growth of the company.

You will also contribute to our fear-free development process by writing tooling to help the team move faster and more sustainably. You will be supported by continuous builds, tests, a constructive review system, and a culture of improving our processes.

Salary range: £75,000 - 85,000 depending on experience.
About you

You will thrive in this role if you:
• Have a strong understanding of Python, its ecosystem, and its internals. You generally have a track record of excellent engineering skills across multiple domains.
• Have strong experience with a variety of modern ML tooling and frameworks, including at least one of PyTorch, JAX, or Tensorflow.
• Have experience in leading the development of machine learning-based products, especially around recommendation systems for time-series data.
• Have experience (and/or strong interest) in building models that understand and reason about complex physical and chemical processes.
• Have a solid understanding of Machine Learning, from foundations to modern approaches, as well as the state of the field and ecosystem.
• Enjoy developing tools across the full ML life cycle for ML-centric products.
• Enjoy running experiments in a rigorous way, and developing better ways to do so.
• Are familiar with modern compute infrastructure stacks such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Cloudflare, etc.
• Have experience taking a leading role in the growth of your team.
• Are strongly interested in making a positive impact towards quickly mitigating climate change.

Note that if you don’t meet all of these qualifications, you should still consider applying. We are building a diverse company with people coming from all sorts of backgrounds and with different skill sets.
About us

We don’t draw a specific line between engineering and research teams. We all share the same tech stack, knowledge, tools, and work. We do fundamental machine learning research, and we build and ship commercial-quality software, so with time you will be likely to equally learn and care about many different aspects of our stack. We aim to create software that helps us achieve our mission in a sustainable and principled way, and to share our findings in the open through publications and open-source development.

We are acting now. Due to the cumulative radiative forcing effect, one tonne of carbon saved today will help us meet global temperature targets as much as two tonnes saved in 2050. The cumulative impact of immediate operational improvements on carbon-producing processes will deliver greater reduction in global heating than many longer-term capital intensive solutions. Simply put: we need to prioritise cuts today and our solutions help to achieve this.

We value diversity, equity, and inclusivity. We are still a small team and are committed to growing in an inclusive manner. We want to augment our team with talented, compassionate people irrespective of race, colour, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, physical or mental disability, or age. Carbon Re is an equal opportunity employer.

We are a young start-up, and our benefits package will change and improve quickly as we grow. At the moment, benefits include:
• Substantial equity in the form of share options.
• Flexible working arrangements (but ideally 2-3 days per week in our London office).
• 25 days of annual leave / paid time off.
• Cyclescheme.
• A great pension scheme"

About us:

We're here to make money work for everyone and we're doing things differently. For too long, banking has been obtuse, complex and opaque.

We want to change that and build a bank with everyone, for everyone. Our amazing community suggests features, test the app and give us constant feedback so we can build something everyone loves.

We're focused on solving problems, rather than selling financial products. We want to make the world a better place and change people's lives through Monzo.

About our Machine Learning, Financial Crime Team:

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you'll be working in an ever changing environment where we are building and iterating on our financial crime defence capabilities to ensure we keep Monzo and our customers safe. As a financial crime team we have a large impact on Monzo's bottom line as fraud and scams are usually some of the largest cost line items in a bank's P&L. In addition, we have a great influence on the overall... customer experience and it's our duty to keep them safe. Most of the work we do results in directly measurable customer or company benefit which is incredibly satisfying.

Our Machine Learning Scientists don't have a permanent assignment to a problem space and might rotate into different financial crime areas after some time. The major problem spaces that we are working in are: fraud prevention, transaction monitoring for different types of suspicious activity, customer risk assessment and operational tooling to name the biggest ones. At the moment we are about 21 people in financial crime data, including Analytics Engineers, Data Analysts, Machine Learning Scientist and Data Scientists.

What you'll be working on:

As part of your job you'll work closely with product managers, data scientists, backend engineers, designers and researchers in an agile product environment. You'll champion the use of data and machine learning techniques, bring ideas to life through rigorous experimentation and A/B testing. You'll help us get the most out of large volumes of data stored on a modern cloud native data platform and with spotting opportunities to make each area of financial crime work even better for our users and for Monzo.

Our culture is open and focused on collaboration between different functions and individuals. It is fast paced and innovative where we try to push the boundaries of the current financial industry best practices. We put a lot of emphasis on feedback (up, side and downwards) and personal growth and development.

Your day-to-day

You'll be a member of the machine learning discipline, working within a product squad in financial crime to help to design, build, analyse, and experiment with machine learning systems that make use of the data we gather.

We organise our machine learning projects into three distinct phases; you'll spend your time doing all three:
• Explore. We use BigQuery and Jupyter Notebooks to analyse data and design machine learning models for offline evaluation. For example, we are investigating machine learning powered assistants for our customer operations team, classifiers to detect financial fraud or to assess customer risk at signup.
• Launch. We build Python micro services and cron jobs to put promising machine learning models into production. We are actively working on automating as much of this step as possible: our goal is for any data scientist or ML engineer to be able to deploy a promising new model to production in less than a day.
• Iterate. We run A/B tests in partnership with other teams and analyse the results. Based on outcomes, we may decide to roll the model out to every customer or to explore improvements to the model for further testing.

You should apply if:

What we're doing here at Monzo excites you!
• You're impact driven and excited to own the end to end journey that starts with a business problem and ends with your solution having a measurable impact in production
• You have a self-starter mindset; you proactively identify issues and opportunities and tackle them without being told to do so
• Reducing financial crime and protecting customers with data driven strategies sounds exciting to you
• You have a solid grounding in SQL and Python, are comfortable using them every day, and keen to learn Go lang which is used in many of our microservices
• You have multiple years of experience using machine learning techniques to tackle real business problems preferably in a fast moving tech company
• You are comfortable exploring potentially ambiguous business problems within a complex and rapidly growing organisation
• You're excited about the potential of machine learning and can communicate those ideas to colleagues who are not familiar with the domain
• You're adaptable, curious and enjoy learning new technologies and ideas

Nice to haves:
• Experience from working with financial crime and regulated institutions
• You have commercial experience writing critical production code and working with microservices

The Interview Process:

Our interview process involves 3 main stages We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions!
• 30 minute recruiter call
• 45 minute call with hiring manager
• 1 take home task
• 2 x 1-hour video calls with various team members

Our average process takes around 3-4 weeks but we will always work around your availability. You will have the chance to speak to our recruitment team at various points during your process but if you do have any specific questions ahead of this please contact us on tech-hiring@monzo.com

What's in it for you:

Senior AI/ML Engineer – Sequence Learning

At GSK we see a world in which advanced applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) will allow us to develop novel therapies to existing diseases and to quickly respond to emerging or changing diseases with personalized drugs, driving better outcomes at reduced cost with fewer side effects. It is an ambitious vision that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of AI/ML. If that excites you, we'd love to chat.

The AI/ML Sequence Learning Team applies machine learning and AI methods to biological sequence (DNA, RNA, protein) data from large-scale human genetic, functional genomic and single cell experiments. Models operating directly on sequence data that can infer how variants alter protein/RNA abundance, structure and function have the potential to be transformative in drug discovery, empowering us to find new life... saving medicines.

We are looking for a Senior AI/ML Engineer to help us make this vision a reality. Competitive candidates will have a track record in developing state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models for solving challenging real world scientific problems. You should be an outstanding scientist with in-depth knowledge in modern machine learning. You can convert vaguely described biological/drug discovery challenges into well-defined machine learning problems. You can independently execute and deliver full AI/ML driven solutions from sourcing training data, design and implementing SOTA machine learning models, testing, benchmarking and product driven research for model performance improvement, to shipping stable, tested, performant code and services in an agile environment.

The AI/ML team is built on the principles of ownership, accountability, continuous development, and collaboration. We hire for the long term, and we're motivated to make this a great place to work. Our leaders will be committed to your career and development from day one.

We’re combining the power of genetic and genomic insights into what causes disease, with the speed and scale of AI/ML to make better predictions about who a treatment might work for, and why. We believe this powerful combination of data and technology holds the key to fundamentally transforming medical discovery for the better, improving R&D success rates and shaping how even the most challenging diseases, like neurological conditions and cancer, can be both prevented and treated.

In 2021 we delivered four major product approvals: Cabenuva for HIV, Jemperli for endometrial cancer, Xevudy for COVID-19 and Apretude, our new long-acting medicine for HIV prevention.

This curiosity pushes us to seek truth and understanding in everything we do, to execute work in a nimble and pragmatic manner, to foster talent in one another and always to challenge assumptions.

Faculty is the professional challenge of a lifetime. You’ll be surrounded by an impressive group of brilliant minds working to advance our goal of making artificial intelligence real. Our consultants, product developers, business development specialists, operations professionals and more all bring something unique to Faculty, and you’ll learn something new from everyone you meet. You’ll also have the opportunity to make your mark on a high-growth start-up now poised to expand internationally.

Fostering talent is one of our core values, it’s built into our culture and what we offer. Faculty was founded by people who are passionate about continuous learning, and adding value to our people.

Some of our benefits…..

• Genuinely flexible working: We believe people have needs, responsibilities and interests that require something different to a strict working day. We trust people to organise and take accountability for their own work and do our best to support their lives outside Faculty. We provide you with all you need to work from home, including a laptop, keyboard, chair…even Sony headphones!
• Equity, we want you to benefit from Faculty’s growth and success.
• Unlimited holidays: We encourage each other to use this time to take a break, work on personal projects, or to spend time with their friends and family.
• Fantastic private health, optical and dental cover, for you & your family - including 24/7 unlimited virtual private GP appointments and covering pre-existing medical conditions.
• Access to mental health coaching with Sanctus
• Breakfast & Lunch daily, and more fruit, drinks and snacks than you could ever eat (for office-based employees).
