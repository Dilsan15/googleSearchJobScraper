Our team trains unseen object instance segmentation models for a robotic grasping service, to be deployed at logistic warehouses. Our customers handle a huge variety of consumer goods, which is impractical to cover in our training datasets. Despite using several methods to improve generalization on unseen objects, it is challenging to operate on new products, and we notice degradation in our success rates and bin-picking speed.

In this internship you will develop methods to close the real world data loop, and recover from domain drifts. The warehouse grasping sequences are reasonably well controlled, allowing us to localize and label the removed objects with classical computer vision methods. These object instance labels are then used to re-train our models continuously and keep up with the data drift.

The goals of the internship

The challenges in this internship include:
• Improving the automatic-annotation precision, to reach human level
• Developing... automatic failure detection, so we don’t pass bad labels to training
• Solving hard cases, e.g. undesired objects motion due to a failed grasp attempt
• Survey relevant papers and summarize settings, pros and cons
• Publish the work in leading venues such as ICRA, IROS, etc.

Qualifications
• Learning towards a PhD or MsC in CS/EE/ME or other equivalent degree
• Knowledge in Computer Vision
