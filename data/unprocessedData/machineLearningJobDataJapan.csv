﻿Salary: 5M - 10M JPY
﻿Language: English + Japanese (business level)
﻿Contract type: Permanent

Who we are

Laboro.AI is an AI startup company with a mission to help create innovation in every industrial business by providing ""Custom AI"", which is tailor-made AI development for deep learning and other cutting-edge AI and machine learning technologies. Many of our clients are major corporations listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and because we focus on helping them innovate their core business, we support many highly innovative AI projects that have a big industrial impact.

Our unique feature is that we can... provide consistent support from AI application consulting, prototype development, and PoC implementation to AI system development.

If you want to be a part of a star group that connects technology and business, we are looking forward to hearing from you.

Cross-departmental collaboration
• We are unique in that there is very little dis-communication (lack of mutual understanding) between engineers and AI consultants, which is often heard in AI startups.
• Since our mission is to ""connect technology and business"", many of our members are conscious of communicating from both sides of technology and business, and we have a corporate culture to understand each other's position and ideas.

Work-life balance
• We place more emphasis on maximizing the results each individual can achieve in the time they have, rather than spending a long time in the dark to produce results.
• This philosophy is also reflected in our life-work balance. We encourage our employees to think carefully about how they can balance work and private life by clarifying the line between on and off duty and how they can allocate their allotted time.

Flat organization
• All members of the management team have an attitude of listening to the voices of the members, and there is a strong sense of mutual support among the members, which creates a culture in which opinions are exchanged and suggestions are made regardless of position or company history.
• Perhaps due to the relatively high average age of the members, the emphasis is on constructive and meaningful discussions rather than on everyone giving their opinions in a nagging manner.

Roles and Responsibility

AI is constantly catching up on the latest technology, so at Laboro.AI we have created an environment that allows us to constantly keep updating our knowledge and technical skills in cutting-edge areas.

We handle everything from the introduction of cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, to the implementation of PoC and system development using our own and other companies' solutions.

【Specific duties】
• Develop machine learning platforms
• Develop solutions using opportunity learning technologies such as deep learning
• Customize machine learning solutions for client projects
• Provide technical explanations and presentations to customers

Under the direct supervision of the CTO, who is a former strategy consultant and machine learning researcher, you will be involved in the most advanced technologies and solutions in the industry from both the business and academic perspectives. We have consultants on the business side, so you can focus on engineering and continue to update your technical skills in different cutting-edge projects.

Minimum Requirements
• Experience in machine learning research
• Japanese language skills at business level or above
• English proficiency to read English papers

Preferred Requirements
• Master/PhD degree related to computer science

Yaraku is a small start-up located in Shibuya, Tokyo. Our focus is primarily on our web-based Translation Management System application.

Work deeply without interruptions

As developers, we love getting in a flow state, where we become so fully absorbed in programming that almost magically time stands still as code pours out of our fingers. The enemy of this state is interruptions, and so we’ve built a culture that avoids them. For instance, rather than having someone come over to your desk to ask a question, they’ll send you a message through Slack (and you’re free to turn on do not disturb mode so you don’t get annoying notifications). If you’re the kind of developer who likes to pop in your headphones and code in silence for hours on end, this is the place for you.

Freedom and responsibility

You’ll get to choose the tasks you work on, and be responsible for all stages of development: from design to implementation to testing to deployment. We take a hands off... approach to management, and so no one is going to tell you exactly how to do something. Rather, you’ll have the freedom to choose yourself what approach to take, and even which technologies to use.

Craft quality code

We know that taking the time to create clean, quality code pays dividends in the future. Management understands this, and so rather than being pushed to quickly hack something together, you’ll have the time needed to create beautiful code.

Your gateway to Japan

Our team is made up of international developers from around the world, and English is our common language around the office. If you’re looking to move to Japan, we welcome you to apply - no Japanese is required and you don’t need to be living in Japan yet.

Our response to COVID-19

Employees are working from home and will continue remote work in the foreseeable future. For overseas candidates, we’ll have you work remotely until we can secure you a visa.

About the position

As an NLP Developer, you’ll be responsible for the conceptual and theoretical aspects of language-related features in our application. You’ll work closely with the development team to apply NLP-related research into a practical, production-ready implementation.

Skills

Experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Able to take research articles and journals and apply practically

Knowledge of Web Development

Bachelor’s degree in relevant field or 10-years Work Experience (for Visa purposes)

Pluses

Experience with NLP-driven applications is a plus

Experience with AI or Machine Learning is a plus.

Experience or knowledge of DevOps (Docker, Ansible etc) a strong plus.

Benefits

Visa sponsorship

Full Employment under Japanese law (which includes National Health Insurance and Pension)

Commute Fee covered

No Overtime

Remote work possible

Salary

Annual: ¥4,200,000 - 5,040,000

Background
The number of physical qubits available for quantum calculation is continuously increasing in the recent years. Yet a perfect logical qubit with error correction functions has not been accomplished by any quantum computer providers. Fault Tolerant Quantum Computer (FTQC) with enough number of qubits is essential to attain the quantum algorithms which is proved to have quantum advantage. And it is predicted to be accomplished in 10 years or more later.
As the result of the previously mentioned above, the recent quantum computers, known as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer, are constructed by physical qubits that store the data for short periods of time and a set of state control gate without sufficient fidelity. Accompanied with number of qubit growth and the progress of quantum algorithm, not only the research of machine toward the FTQC, but also whether NISQ computers will take an important role of solving... real world problems or not, becomes an attracting question for our society.
Toshiba is working for a sustainable future for the earth and its people by contributing to the realization of carbon neutrality and a circular economy. We are looking for quantum evolution in which quantum technologies drive the social value creation. Toshiba and Japanese partner companies together established the industrial alliance (Q-STAR) to create the quantum industries. Toshiba also becomes a member of the Quantum Innovation Initiative Consortium (QIIC) to conduct quantum computing research by obtaining superior access to IBM’s superconductor type quantum computers via membership to the IBM Quantum Network. We are eager to use this opportunity on quantum machine learning research that is expected to help us achieving our vision.

Expected Research Proposals
We are expecting research proposals related to quantum algorithms available for NISQ devices. In　particular, it may be related to the following items:
- Quantum machine learning algorithms by taking the advantage of the right to access the quantum computers.
- Parametrized quantum circuits optimization methods to tackle the barren plateau problem, reduce its process and be robust to noise.
- Effective techniques related to data encoding, ansatz, error mitigation and efficient quantum state measurement for raising up machine learning abilities.

Citadel AI builds products to test and monitor high-risk AI systems. Our mission is to make the world's AI systems more reliable and trustworthy.

Our company is located in Tokyo, but we have an international team and global customers. We’re building a world-class engineering team here – our founding engineers have previously worked at leading tech companies such as Google Brain, Waymo, PayPal, and Toyota.

This is a unique opportunity to build new products for a global market from Tokyo. As one of Citadel AI's first engineers, you'll have significant impact and ownership over our startup’s trajectory. Our company is extremely well funded, and our first investor was The University of Tokyo.

About the Role

We're hiring backend engineers to work with our small, full-stack team to build products to test, monitor, and improve the reliability of machine learning systems.

You’ll be responsible for building our product’s backend and working with web servers, SQL... databases, parallel computing, API design, multi-cloud architecture, integrating with external services (e.g. SSO), and going as deep into our ML stack as you can.

Our backend is primarily in Python. Some technologies we use are: Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, RQ, Gunicorn, Flask, TensorFlow Extended, Pytest, and many Python ML libraries.

No ML expertise is required for this role, though we hope you’re interested to dive deep into the emerging space of MLOps / trustworthy ML / responsible AI.

As an early employee, you’ll own a significant equity stake in addition to your base salary.

Job Requirements

Our company, technology, and market are new and changing rapidly, so a large part of the job is to adapt and learn new things. We value learning fast over pre-existing knowledge (“slope is more important than y-intercept”).

You should have at least 1 year of backend software engineering experience. We don’t require past experience with specific programming languages or frameworks.

English is required, Japanese is optional. We prioritize candidates in Tokyo, but may consider remote for exceptional candidates.

Nice-to-have: you can work full-stack, you've worked at a startup before, or you have experience with production machine learning"
