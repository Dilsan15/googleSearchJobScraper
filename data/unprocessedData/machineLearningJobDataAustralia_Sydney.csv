Our mission is to master the art and science of measuring and maximizing attention. To do this, we’ve built the world’s first ML system that can measure how long an ad was looked at (a metric we call Attention Time). Fuelled and verified by real eye tracking data, but able to throw off the shackles of panels and instead scale infinitely across the world wide web, our system is set to revolutionize the way that digital media is measured, bought and sold.

We are an enthusiastic global team and a fast-growing business with every major agency group and a great list of top tier publishers using our technology. We’re a team of adtech experts with an unrelenting focus on quality products and technology. Our tech is being used by top 100 brands across the globe. We’ve won coveted ‘Marketing... Technology Company of the Year’ awards from both B&T and Mumbrella and featured twice as a Rising Star in the Deloitte Fast 50 Technology Awards.

The opportunity…

To support our next phase of product development we’re looking for an ML and Data Science focused engineer to join our Attention Science product team and report into our Chief Scientist. The Attention Intelligence Platform (AIP) is the world’s first machine learning powered ad stack built to measure and maximize Attention Time on ads. AIP depends on high quality eye tracking panel data collected in ad recall studies. It’s an award-winning solution for brands that want to succeed in the attention economy and secure the best possible results from their ad spend.

In this role you’ll be developing machine learning models and integrating them into our mobile application data processing stack.

Key skills include: Experience with object detection systems in pyTorch or TensorFlow. Experience in optimizing ML systems for latency and model size. Experience with building cloud based ML Solutions using technologies preferably in GCP.

What you’ll be doing…
• Building and evaluating CV object detection models for mobile apps screens
• Integrating models into a GCP scoring pipeline
• Developing post-processing algorithms that integrate multiple detections
• Optimizing pipelines that balance performance tradeoffs (accuracy vs speed)
• Working with pipeline engineers to optimize performance in cloud
• Reducing model size or methodology where appropriate
• Working with our data labeling team for new object detection projects

Who you are…
• 5 to 8 years as a Software Engineer
• You have 3+ years experience in a machine learning development role
• Strong programming skills with Python and Unix
• Experience with Object Detection methods and packages (e.g. YOLO)
• Experience in setting up model training pipelines in the cloud (preferably GCP)
• You focus on practical outcomes rather than the latest algorithms.
• Open and collaborative nature:
• * You provide detailed documentation on your experiments
• You are open to discuss your experiments and work through problems.

The perks…
• The opportunity to ride a rocket ship. You’ll play a pivotal part in our business during its 'scale up' phase by supporting the delivery of game-changing new products.
• An amazing company culture, driven by passionate people who love their work, but also love to have FUN!
• The opportunity to work with some cutting edge technologies as well as the freedom to continue to push the boundaries of what we do.
• Career progression galore. The company is growing at a crazy rate and you will be too!
• A progressive work from home policy.
• A competitive salary package"

About the Group

The Search and Recommendations Group is a core component of the Canva user experience. They are responsible for providing the core platform that allows all of Canva's amazing templates, images... stickers, video, audio, etc, to be discovered inside and outside Canva. With that, they also own key in-product surfaces to allow users to discover content before and during design.

With over 100 million assets in our library (and rapidly growing), this group is key in ensuring that every user in every locale can find the content they need to create amazing designs. With so much content, surfacing the right ingredients to the right user, at the right time will be critical for the future success of Canva.

About the Product Design specialty

One of the principles of our design team is to ‘show the future’. As designers, we transport the rest of the company into a future we’re yet to build. A big part of the role of a product designer at Canva is to be a visionary—visualising and reinventing the future of design.

There is a magic that occurs where design and engineering collide – that has been the philosophy that has driven the success of a lot of our product experiences. We’re looking for someone who understands this magic and can work within the design team to help craft experiences that are detailed, polished, and push the boundaries of what’s technically possible, as well as inspire teams and leaders to invest in new ideas.

As a creative technologist, you’ll be part of the Product Design specialty, collaborating with all of our product designers to come up with interesting solutions to design problems, prototype new ideas, and figure out the details that go into a good design before they get fully built. You’ll also be an invaluable bridge between the design and engineering teams, helping the full vision of the design team to roll out to our millions of users"

Future thank you note (what success looks like)

Hi New Abyss Team Member,

We’re so happy you joined us!

Thank you for jumping in and getting to know our codebase and helping us improve it. We pride ourselves on simple, readable code and your suggestions and contributions to our coding guidelines helped us refine that further!

We appreciate how you took the lead on [new technology proof-of-concept / automated network performance monitoring framework / ML prediction pipeline / machine learning interest group] - the way you confirmed the key considerations and collaborated with the team to come up with a recommendation really helped us plan it out and get the groundwork implemented.

You also did a great job coaching team members when needed. We loved how you were able to guide others’ learning through working with them on implementing product features based on our coding guidelines and your expertise with the tech stack, troubleshooting tricky issues and collaborating on technical design - and all this in whichever way was most helpful based on their skill level. Your ability to figure out the appropriate tasks to delegate to others and the balance between the amount of guidance vs independence they need really helped our team skill up.

The tech lead in particular really appreciates how you worked closely with them and the product designer to help us design and plan what we build. Given a business initiative and particular prioritised user problems, you helped us ensure that we’ve considered as much as we can from a technical perspective so that we can plan for it.

We hope that you’ve enjoyed working with the team so far, excited to see what you can achieve next!
