The Lab will research the state-of-art AI technologies to build the cornerstone for the intelligent management of autonomous driving networks.

As a Senior AI researcher your knowledge and experience in designing and building intelligent systems will be applied to solve challenging real-world problems in the areas of network assurance, network healing (fault prediction, root cause analysis, remediation actions planning) and network optimisation (control parameter optimisation, resource allocation), and predictive modelling.

Despite its great success, purely data-driven AI systems in general and Machine Learning systems in particular have their limits when dealing with training data that are insufficient, unbalanced or... contain very few examples of important rare events. There are two potential solutions to this inefficiency. First, the additional integration of prior knowledge (usually in some symbolic form) in the training and inference process, which leads to the notion of Knowledge-driven Machine Learning. Second, the incorporation of data-centric AI techniques, which seek to systematically engineer the data to improve its quality.

We are looking for enthusiastic, motivated AI researchers that have practical experience with knowledge-driven and data-centric AI methods. More specifically:
• Integration of knowledge into the learning and inference process, through the use of knowledge embedding or reasoning based on symbolic knowledge representations (i.e. knowledge graph, logic rules, algebraic equations).
• Graph data science to gain knowledge from relationships and structure in data in order to empower predictions.
• Learning and inference in small data regimes, through the use of few-shot learning.
• Continual Learning and inference that is robust to distributional drifts and that quickly adapts and generalises to these changes with few examples.

Key responsibilities include:
• Identify the state-of-art (both in industry and in academic literature) of AI technologies for solving problems in the domain of Autonomous Driving Networks.
• Contribute to rapid and iterative development of validated prototypes based on AI technologies, and benchmark alternative solutions.
• Work closely with Domain Experts, Data Engineers, and Data Scientists. Collaborate with product development teams and partners in Businesses to productionise AI technologies, including providing source code and design documents.

Requirements
• PhD in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or related field.
• 5+ years of industrial research experience in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Operations Research, or related field.
• Strong practical experience with Machine Learning (i.e., Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Ensemble models, Clustering, Association relationship mining, Bayesian Networks).
• Experience with knowledge reasoning methods (i.e. neural methods via knowledge graph embedding, or symbolic methods via rule-based reasoning, and/or neuro-symbolic methods)
• Experience with data-centric AI methods (i.e. drift detection, data augmentation, data balancing, outlier removal) for systematic engineering of training data prior to model induction.
• Good mathematics and statistics background.
• Strong programming skills in Python.
• Practical skills in the use of machine learning frameworks, i.e., Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Pytorch, Spark MLlib.
• Problem solving ability, and demonstrated ability to develop new algorithms and methodologies from leading open source initiatives and research papers.
• Publication track records in machine learning and computer science conferences and journals, including, but not limited to, ICML, ECML, NIPS, AAAI, IJCAI, IJCNN is a great plus.

Benefits
• Paid Time Off

Contract: Full-time/Fixed Term

Tyndall National Institute is a leading European research centre in integrated ICT (Information and Communications Technology) hardware and systems. Specialising in both electronics and photonics – materials, devices, circuits and systems – we are globally leading in our core research areas of bio-photonics, bioelectronics, biomedical devices and systems. As the national institute for photonics and micro/nanoelectronics and a research flagship of UCC, the institute employs 600 researchers, engineers and support staff, including 120 full-time graduate students. Tyndall is the lead institute for the Irish Photonics Integration Centre (IPIC) and European Space Agency (ESA) Space Solutions Centre Ireland and hosts industry-aligned research centres; Microelectronic Circuits Centre Ireland (MCCI); International Energy Research Centre (IERC); and... the Centre for Future Networks and Communications (CONNECT).

Reporting to Prof. Padraig Cantillon-Murphy, this position involves the development of new algorithms including machine learning approaches for intelligent visualisation of tool position within magnetic tracking. The student will be based at the Tyndall National Institute with a student’s appointment in the School of Engineering, University College Cork.

Magnetic Tracking is a technology which enables the use of navigated instruments in image-guided interventions such as surgery without the use of x-rays. Magnetic tracking involves the use of frequency-modulated magnetic fields in the volume of interest. These fields are detected by tiny sensors (currently under development at MCCI) embedded within surgical tools and instruments. This approach works well in the absence of metal distortion of the magnetic field from other large medical equipment such as CT imaging machines.

The aim of this project is to develop new algorithms which provide intelligent visualisation of the tracked tool position. To date, the algorithm to determine the tracked tool position is determined by a non-linear least-squares regression approach without any additional input. This project will combine a priori tool position, supplementary sensor inputs and possibly machine learning approaches to determine an ‘intelligent’ tool position. This work will take place in Python but Matlab and C may also be used, particularly for edge-based computing. Finally, the project will look to provide a visualisation of the tool position in the virtual 3D Slicer environment. 3D Slicer is an open-source visualisation platform for image-guided surgery (https://www.slicer.org/) which is in C and Python.

Responsibilities

The candidate is expected to be creative, self-motivated, and should help create an efficiently and friendly atmosphere within the research team at UCC and Tyndall.
• Propose innovative approaches for intelligent visualisation of tool position in magnetic tracking.
• With guidance, implement visualisation of the optimised tool position in the 3D Slicer environment. This involves Python-based implementation using real and simulated tracking data, as well as interfacing with the system-level hardware already available in the research group.
• Engage in the dissemination of the results of the research, as directed by and with the support of senior Tyndall and UCC research staff.

Essential Criteria:
• The minimum academic qualification is a first or upper second class honours degree (or an equivalent international degree) in electrical engineering, industrial physics, electronic engineering, physics or related relevant discipline.
• The successful candidate will be highly analytical with good interpersonal and organisational skills.

Desirable Criteria
• Knowledge of Python, Matlab, Mathematica, and LaTeX.
• Good mathematical ability and knowledge of signal processing.
• Knowledge of interface between hardware and software systems.
• The successful candidate will be highly innovative with a strong desire to create world-beating solutions in the area of magnetic tracking for image-guided surgery.

An annual student stipend of €18,500 applies for this successful candidate for this position. Yearly University academic fees will paid by the Tyndall National Institute.

For any informal queries, please contact Prof. Padraig Cantillon-Murphy at P.CantillonMurphy@ucc.ie"
