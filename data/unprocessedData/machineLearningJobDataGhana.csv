Machines are increasingly awesome at understanding English, but what about the 5+ billion people who need to communicate in their native language?

Proto automates multilingual customer support with a vertically-integrated product suite and the proprietary Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine for Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Swahili, Igbo, Yoruba, Thai and many more languages. Our core tech includes IP for mixed-language understanding and semi-supervised chat history structuring (we really love NLP).

We’re a fast-growing SaaS business with a laser-focus on being the AI Customer Experience (AICX) market-leader within the Financial, Energy and Gaming verticals in priority emerging markets.

How We Work

Build fast with usage: We deploy functional products and iterate fast with real-time usage. With this... approach, Proto rapidly implements cutting-edge NLP tech.

Lead first into frontiers: We target customer segments in underserved markets around the world. With this curiosity, Proto ventures first where others overlook.

Stay Hyper-Global: We’re a team with Taiwanese and Rwandan devs, building Canadian software, powered by Thai NLP for Swedish clients based in the Philippines.

OUR TECH & ROADMAP

Proto is driven by its passion to ensure that the conversational AI revolution benefits everyone from all corners of the Earth. To do this, we’re commercializing localized NLP techniques for every task in the customer support domain: livechat, ticketing, translation, chatbot training, upselling, and more. The combined power of the product suite and the NLP engine outperforms singular solutions like Microsoft LUIS or Zendesk in emerging markets.

In terms of the product suite, the backend of Proto consists of several python (micro) services communicating through a message queue server. This infrastructure is optimized for clients with 24/7 contact centers thus, testing and high-availability are critical to us. We are hosted on a multi-region GCP infrastructure and rely heavily on Kubernetes and Google Cloud SQL (Postgres) to achieve high levels of stability and performance. The frontend of Proto consists of interfaces with cutting-edge UX principles that blend AI functionality with the tasks of contact center agents.

In terms of the NLP engine, Proto’s research team is constantly testing and deploying the latest deep-learning techniques for domain and language-specific phenomena (i.e. slang within the Filipino financial complaints domain). This NLP research and development is always client-driven with immediate deployment into the field and with support from the governments of Canada and the European Union.

Proto’s roadmap is focused on proactive chat, churn prediction and increased vertical-integration as the AI Customer Experience industry consolidates.
