Would you like to be a part of Recordly's story? Now is your chance! We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer eager to help businesses capitalize on the opportunities data and machine learning offer. Working at Recordly means you get to work with customers that truly want to make data and ML/AI their competitive edge.

“WHO/WHAT IS RECORDLY?” YOU MIGHT ASK

Recordly is an independent company part of the Futurice family that specializes in business data management. Our core business focuses on data management, data architectures, and hands-on data engineering that enable exceptional user experiences, efficiency gains, and new business models. In simple terms, we tech the heck out of data.

Our employee promise (besides offering engaging customer assignments of course) includes the possibility to enjoy the company's success and shape who we are and what we do, together. We believe in being open about how the business is going and how the choices we make... affect the bottom line. Take a look at our site to get to know us better.

NOW TO THE ROLE ITSELF

A Machine Learning Engineer at Recordly typically works in tight cooperation with very skilled colleagues and our customers within different assignments. Assignments vary and typically require hands-on work from time to time - meaning you may have to open up AWS/Azure/GCP Console and deploy some machine learning resources or write some MLOps stuff or data pipelines when the Data Engineers are not around.

As we focus on creating actual business value by creating or utilizing for example data and machine learning platforms, we value the following skills:
• Technical skills, both verbal and written, along with the ability to influence and demonstrate confidence in communications with data and machine learning technologies such as
• Fluent with cloud infrastructure, especially the data side of the big three. We don’t expect you to be certified (we can help you with that), but work experience at least within one of the big three is needed.

The project has emerged from the need to redefine and renegotiate the roles of human and machine in society and from the need of cross-disciplinary collaboration understand this rising area. Job descriptionWe are looking for a Doctoral Researcher in the area of creative industries and machine learning to pursue a doctorate in the field of ""AI/Human-generated worlds: Merging psychophysiology and machine learning for creating virtual realities"".Successful candidates will pursue a doctoral degree at Tampere University. Full-time doctoral studies are expected to be completed in four years.An applicant may only apply for maximum 3 Convergence positions from this list. This position number is 01.Short description: The creation of art (i.e., visual, auditory, and other multimedia content) conceived by artificial intelligence has recently peaked as a shock and a harbinger of how the future may develop what comes to human ingenuity and the alleged uniquity of human experience, aesthetic perception, and self-concept in terms of autonomy and innovative capability. This phenomenon is perhaps most comprehensively visible in the dynamic and automatic generation of 3D multimodal environments and experience through multisense VR technology. In the future, it will be possible for AI to generate, dynamically and in real-time, content that maximizes the hedonic fit to the human observer based on the measurement of psychophysiological signals, creating limitless bioadaptive experiences. It is currently feasible and realistic to anticipate that these multimodal, high-fidelity, and highly interactive and engrossing experiences will become not only possible, but a part of our everyday in various domains, from psychotherapy and education to leisure. There are several dystopian and utopian future scenarios – as well as psychological, philosophical, and technological lines of engineering and inquiry – that can be wielded to better anticipate and even shape related, possible futures, as well as to understand their consequences. These issues not only pose practical questions to the industries where AI may be replacing previously human labor. They further question human experience and the philosophical premises of what conscious innovation, autonomy, and creativity mean.While the topic has become increasingly noticed – mostly as a curiosity of generative art – there are potential future ramifications related to how we design, experience and make sense of machine-generated content and, by consequence, human-made content, art, and experiences. They call for acute and cross-disciplinary research efforts that are literate in both machine intelligence and experience as well as human intelligence and experience. Holistic understanding of these emerging phenomena is needed for nurturing human prosperity and avoiding the dangers of future immersive AI-generated experiences becoming a modern oubliette.Tentative Research problems/questions: What are the current and potential future applications of AI-generated multimodal and bioadaptive experiences and what are their implications in understanding the human condition, innovation, and creativity?The research aims described below are to be intrinsically intertwined in informing and guiding each stage of the project. The three aims reflect 1) development and evaluation of AI systems, 2) understanding their wider socio-technological landscape, and 3) detection and explication of related implications and, consequently, frameworks or guidelines for future practitioners and researchers. Due research activities include:Mapping relevant current and future landscapes of AI-generated immersive experiences (state-of-the-art and futures research grounded in and projected from the capabilities of cutting-edge engineering)Conceiving, producing, and testing cutting-edge prototypes of AI-generated experiences (innovative demo experiences employing generative content trained on psychophysiological readings and evaluated in terms of its implications on individuals’ perception and understanding of self and creativity)Outlining possibilities and pitfalls, as well as design and ethical considerations of future of AI-generated experiencesRequirementsThe applicant needs to have a Master’s degree in any related social science, arts and humanities or engineering field, but preferably one related to the creative industries with a strong orientation to new technologies.

Thesis writing is a doorway from study life to work life if pursued well. However, most of us feel lost in the sea of study as there is a plethora of courses and things to do. Another trap that we often fall victim to is that we take whatever comes our way or something that seems easy. But the opportunity cost of falling into such a trap is way too high - we not only miss the opportunity to hone a skill that would land a dream job for us but also the self-confidence that comes with it.

That's why we are building an AI tool to revolutionize the experience of thesis/research writing for students. We help students find a research topic (research gap) and equip them with tools, templates, and frameworks to boost their productivity and shorten the time to complete their thesis.

You are an excellent technologist with good experience.

Qualifications:
• A knack for learning and creating.
• A few years of experience in NLP AI model development would be interesting.
• Good English language as it is the language of the startup.

Key Responsibilities:
• Design and develop natural language processing systems
• Define appropriate datasets for language learning
• Use effective text representations to transform natural language into useful features
• Develop NLP systems according to requirements

The applicant may only apply for up to 3 positions within Convergence. If you are unsure if this (#11) is the correct one – please, check the website with the list of Convergence positions. Make your selection first and only apply the ones that are suitable for your background.Project backgroundConvergence is a new research field that brings together academics from Social Sciences & Humanities and Technology & Engineering to train the next generation of Doctoral Expertise and address future challenges and opportunities of multidisciplinary Convergence of Humans and Machines. Convergence is funded by the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation.Convergence is based on the premise that, on the one hand, people are increasingly integrated with technology and our culture and practices are increasingly dictated by information technology. On the other hand, machines are becoming more alive, creative, and dynamic. In other words, human and machine are converging. The project has emerged from the need to redefine and renegotiate the roles of human and machine in society and from the need of cross-disciplinary collaboration understand this rising area. Job descriptionWe are looking for a Doctoral Researcher in the area combining engineering disciplines including sensors, wearables, Internet-of-Things and Machine Learning with human aspects such as user perceptions, emotions and social relations, to pursue research towards “Combining IoT Sensors and Machine Learning to Detect Emotions and Social Experiences” field.Successful candidates will pursue a doctoral degree at Tampere University. Full-time doctoral studies are expected to be completed in four years.An applicant may only apply for maximum 3 Convergence positions from this list. This position number is 11.Short description: Previous research at Tampere University has used machine learning on IoT/wearable sensor data (e.g., accelerometers, ECG sensors) for detecting onset of different diseases such as diabetes or Parkinson’s disease. We have carried out research on using machine learning for correlating sensor data with perceived loneliness. We have also explored emotions and experiences from social science and sociolinguistic perspectives.The idea of this doctoral research topic is to extend to detecting emotions and social experiences, by applying machine perception on joint IoT and human-generated data. The applications of such AI-based real-time detection can be found in (but not restricted to) affective computing, e.g., providing emotion feedback to social media applications and online journalistic content, or in monitoring emotions of intensive care residents or patients with mental disorders. The application areas have also connections to sociolinguistics, journalism/media research, medicine, and psychology. One possible question that the research could answer with a reasonable confidence is “What does the (social) media content or real-life event evoke in the mind?” by using sensor information, possibly including also imaging, and artificial intelligence.Both exploitation of existing labeled online databases and laboratory experiments are foreseen to comprise the work, including also a great deal of applying supervised machine learning for feature extraction and data clustering. For maximum autonomy and security, such detection of emotions must be context-aware and privacy-preserving, as well as independent of the actual devices or platforms used. In the planned research, there will also be collaboration with colleagues in Finland and abroad.Tentative Research problems/questions: How do measured physical features correlate with emotions?Which Machine Learning methods would be the most useful for detecting emotions?How to use wearables/IoT measurements to provide emotional feedback?What kind of human-machine interfaces would be useful for affective computing?How to integrate social scientific and/or sociolinguistic approach to emotions into human-machine convergence research?RequirementsThe applicant needs to have a Master’s degree in some of the related fields and have demonstrated (during your studies towards the Master’s degree or otherwise) the competence and motivation to pursue postgraduate studies.
