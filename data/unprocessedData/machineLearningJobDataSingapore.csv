The degradation of building façade materials such as sealants, gaskets or cement plasters, can be due to weathering which causes the materials to harden and dry out, or exposure to ultraviolet light/ thermal conditions. This project focuses on the service life prediction of these materials, subject to the cyclical environmental loading conditions. A mechanism based degradation model for the selected façade material is to be developed, calibrated and validated against laboratory data obtained from accelerated weathering tests. To capture the intricate relations between different environmental loads, the project will work towards the development of a coupled mechanism model (e.g. hydro-thermal degradation), to enable the climate parameters (temperature cycles, precipitation, etc.) to be better implemented in the service life prediction. The candidate will have to use machine learning techniques to come out with prediction models using the test data from the field... specimens, accelerated weathering samples and also numerical simulation results.

Job Requirements
• Possess at least a recognised Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computational Physics or any disciplines relevant to the project.
• Proficient in: mechanics of materials, non-linear finite element techniques (theory, numerical implementation, analysis) and numerical methods
• At least 2 years of relevant experience in constitutive model development, writing of subroutines for FE implementation and machine Learning.
• Open to fixed-term contract

Des Cartes Program is looking for 1 year position in Optimization-driven hybrid AI DESCARTES PROGRAM The Des Cartes programme is developing a hybrid AI, combining Learning, Knowledge and Reasoning, which has good properties (need for less resources and data, security, robustness, fairness, respect for privacy, ethics), and demonstrated on industrial applications of the smart city (digital energy, monitoring of structures, air traffic control).The

program brings together 80 permanent researchers (half from France, half from Singapore), with the support of large industrial groups (Thales SG, EDF SG, ESI group, CETIM Matcor, ARIA etc.).The research will take place mainly in Singapore, ises of CNRS@CREATE, with a competitive salary and generous funding for missions.

Read more about the Des Cartes program .DESCRIPTIONWP3 aims at supporting the whole Descartes program in order to develop advanced... optimization-based solutions in the context of hybrid AI. Any AI system or machine learning algorithm ultimately involves a formulation with an objective tion to be minimized. The modelling of the problem as well as the chosen objective function optimization algorithm is crucial to the success of the overall AI task.

This is all the more crucial in the context of hybrid AI, which seeks to integrate physics-inspired models with machine learning algorithms. We will address this problem from two complementary angles, namely optimization-based methods and machine learning-based methods.

The goal of this postdoctoral position is to solve robust polynomial optimization. The traditional setting uses deterministic uncertainty sets (i.e., neither distributional, nor data-driven). The postdoctoral fellow will consider data-driven distributionally robust optimization, will examine various distributional uncertainty sets, and will also rely on parametric polynomial optimization. Evolutionary algorithms will also be evaluated for solving these robust optimization problems.

Job Description

The degradation of building façade materials such as sealants, gaskets or cement plasters, can be due to weathering which causes the materials to harden and dry out, or exposure to ultraviolet light/ thermal conditions. This project focuses on the service life prediction of these materials, subject to the cyclical environmental loading conditions. A mechanism based degradation model for the selected façade material is to be developed, calibrated and validated against laboratory data obtained from accelerated weathering tests. To capture the intricate relations between different environmental loads, the project will work towards the development of a coupled mechanism model (e.g. hydro-thermal degradation), to enable the climate parameters (temperature cycles, precipitation, etc.) to be better implemented in the service life prediction. The candidate... will have to use machine learning techniques to come out with prediction models using the test data from the field specimens, accelerated weathering samples and also numerical simulation results.

Job Requirements
• Possess at least a recognised Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computational Physics or any disciplines relevant to the project.
• Proficient in: mechanics of materials, non-linear finite element techniques (theory, numerical implementation, analysis) and numerical methods
• At least 2 years of relevant experience in constitutive model development, writing of subroutines for FE implementation and machine Learning.
• Open to fixed-term contract
