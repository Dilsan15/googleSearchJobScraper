Who you are
You probably have a background in computer science, software... engineering or a similar topic, though your technical skills together with your ability to learn very fast, work independently and collaboratively are what really matters.

Since we are a small team, a new member will have to fit well into our group and our informal mentality. You should be open to work on a wide range of tasks from our offices in Copenhagen.

Your main responsibility in Radiobotics will be to lead our machine learning and deep learning algorithm development efforts by improving our existing ML/DL pipeline and process, and being part of developing algorithms for Radiobotics' innovative products.

Pytorch, Tensorflow, OpenCV and Jupyter Notebooks are your everyday jam and you deploy comfortably knowing that your model generalizes well.

Being a small company we all wear many hats and we also expect you to bring your experience building software to improve and bring a fresh perspective to our products’ software.

You’ll already know all your new colleagues, who does what within Radiobotics, and who can help you out when you feel lost. Moreover, you will have enjoyed a few delicious breakfasts and Friday bars. You’ll be up and running with the hardware and software you need to code and be familiarized with our documentation and processes. You have already made and reviewed a few pull requests and trained your first model.

After 1 month…
You’ll be working on new features for our products and contributed to some of our ML/DL development processes. You will have had a few 1:1 meetings with your manager and your latte art game will be on point. You’ll start naming everything in your life with the RB prefix (like our products).

After 3 months...
You’ll be leading projects, writing PRs and collaborating in the design and development of Radiobotics. You will have participated in a few RBactivities outside the office and have your personal ranking of your favorite almond croissants in the city.

After 6 months...
By this date, you won’t be the RBrookie anymore, so you’ll be the lead in some projects and will be co-authoring the way we work, develop product features and deploy products at Radiobotics. Your work will most likely be already in use by radiologists, technological partners and the rest of the company. Depending on the timing, you’ll have attended a hackathon/work-away and you will have developed competitive Foosball/Petanque skills you didn’t know you had.

What we expect from you
• You have minimum 3+ years industry experience applying ML/DL/CV to tackle real-world problems, including object detection in large datasets.
• You are skilled in explaining and presenting analyses and concepts to a broad technical audience.

However, simulations are limited by computational power, and thus are also the technologies and materials that can we develop to e.g. aid in the green transition.To allow larger and more complex simulations of physical systems, we wish to do simulations where the physics only have to be solved in a few discrete points, and then use deep learning to fill in the simulation in the remaining space in a physically correct way. We want to initially attempt this for magnetic fields because magnets are used in a large number of sustainable applications and their physics is well-described and understood.To investigate if we can make deep learning physics-informed, this postdoc position will work initially on building a deep generative model, which is able to interpolate and extrapolate a high-resolution magnetic field from a few, given measurements in a... physically correct way. To achieve this, the model is not only trained on simulated magnetic field data but also on fulfilling the governing physics of magnetic fields i.e. Maxwell’s equations. The now physics-aware technique can then be transferred to additional physics subsequently by defining similar appropriate models for these. We will generate training data using our own simulation framework for magnets, called MagTense.Responsibilities and qualificationsThe postdoc will consider two complementary approaches based on deep generative models e.g. generative adversarial networks, denoising diffusion probabilistic models, variational autoencoders, and normalizing flows. In the first approach, we want to embed the governing physics during the training of the deep learning architecture, while in the second approach our physical model i.e. MagTense is directly targeted and incorporated into the learning process. The position will be conducted together with a postdoc at DTU Compute, who is similarly working on physics-aware machine learning as part of a Villum Foundation Synergy Project. Based on this close collaboration with expertise from both physics and computer science, we aim to unleash the potential of combining machine learning with physical simulations to speed up the green transition.Qualified applicants must ideally have:
PhD degree in computer science, physics, or similar.
Strong background in numerical work and machine learning.
Experience with physics or willing to learn this.
Some experience with open source software etc.
Desirable experience with programming languages (e.g., Python or Matlab).
Ability to work independently, to plan and carry out complicated tasks, and to be a part of a large, dynamic group.
Good communication skills in English, both written and spoken.

Application deadline: 6 February 2023.

The research is part of a large European effort, FeatureCloud, to establish privacy-aware federated machine learning approaches to enable the mining of distributed, sensitive data. Currently, one major roadblock of biomedical research is that the valuable data is scattered around the globe, and sharing, and consolidating, data is simply not possible due to privacy concerns. With FeatureCloud, we are seeking to elevate this prohibitive problem by allowing federated machine learning, i.e. we leave the data in the safe harbour of storage and train local models at the sites... thereafter only the model parameters are consolidated in a central instance to create a model of similar capabilities as a conventional model trained on all the available data.

The successful candidate will develop novel approaches for federated machine learning of systems medicine and multi-OMICS data in particular. The candidate will be embedded in a highly international and powerful consortium as a member of the Computational Biology group which offers a wide expertise in machine learning on biomedical data, both in the realm of unsupervised as well as supervised learning. We also provide the candidate with direct access to state-of-the-art computing facilities optimized for deep learning and distributed computing.

Upon successful completion of the PhD study the student will be awarded the PhD degree from Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

This position requires that you are ready to move to Denmark

The aim of the project is to develop novel models, methods, and algorithms for automated open-world system integration where actors use data models that are not a priory known and change over time.

An open-world information supply chain consists of data providers and data consumers with inconsistent and seemingly incompatible data models – yet they still must be able to exchange data. Further, as reporting on sustainability and environmental footprint... by actors in supply chains becomes legal requirements, businesses must ensure consistency of data across the entire information supply chain. Hence, the automated exchange of this data, supported through advanced schema matching models and algorithms can become the pivotal point in the success of these businesses, let alone compliance with regulatory demands.

The project’s success criteria are
Establishing mathematical models and algorithms to enable automated integration of data to and from external actors whose data models change over time Methods and tooling to enable sustainability and environmental data tracking across the information supply chain for every actor in the information supply chain Development of a prototype of a self-integrating data platform that supports seamless exchange of trustworthy data even when data from external actors change over time.

The employment is with Stibo Systems, and the placement of the position is tightly integrated with the Product Management, Research & Development, and Innovation Teams at the Stibo Systems Head Quarter in Højbjerg, Denmark, where the company main supervisor is also located and where we currently have another industrial PhD student researching Recommender Systems for multidomain MDM.

Human-in-the-loop, Data Mining, and Deep Learning Algorithms and Systems on Graph Data: Graph data, e.g., knowledge graphs, social and biological networks, financial transactions, and transportation systems are pervasive in the natural world, where nodes are entities with features and edges represent relations among them. Machine learning and deep learning over graphs become ubiquitous, yet they are “black-box”: It is difficult to understand which aspects of the input graph data drive the decisions of the model. Interpretability can improve the model's transparency related to fairness, privacy, and other safety challenges, thus enhancing the trust in decision-critical applications and ease their adoption in life science, health, law enforcement, and financial domains. To this aim, we shall design a user-in-the-loop interpretation framework that translates deep learning-based findings back to users, supports “why” and “why-not” questions over prediction results... assists users in formulating relevant questions with minimum efforts, and incorporate users’ interactive feedback to improve training data and deep learning models. The project would also focus on scalable graph algorithms and systems to enable novel analysis and make data and results accessible through the integration of multi-modal data.

The aim will be publishing several research papers at top-tier data mining (KDD), data management (SIGMOD, PVLDB, ICDE), or machine learning (NeurIPS, AAAI) conferences based on the research works. Within the area, the position comes with many freedoms in terms of the specific research direction, methodology, and approaches taking the specific project needs into consideration. The selected candidate will be part of the Data Engineering, Science and Systems (DESS) research group, an ambitious and supportive research environment in which we study data engineering, data science, and data systems. Embracing the opportunities enabled by the ongoing, sweeping digitalization of societal, industrial, and scientific processes, we collaborate with our partners to create value from data, targeting the invention of purposeful artifacts, such as frameworks, algorithms, data structures, indexes, languages, and techniques, as well as tools, systems, and prototype software, typically either for proof-of-concept or for the purpose of conducting empirical studies.

Requirements:
The applicants must have a Master’s degree in computer science, data science, artificial intelligence, or a closely related field.

3. CV.
4. Diploma and transcripts of records.
5. Contact of two referees
6. Other relevant information.

Interested applicants are encouraged to contact the project’s principal supervisor, Associate Professor Arijit Khan, Department of Computer Science, e-mail: , regarding the scientific aspects of the position. His research works can be found at and at .

Postdoc Position in Computational Astrochemistry and Machine Learning,2023-01-16,2023-01-30 12:17:30,https://www.google.com/search?q=Machine+Learning+Jobs+Denmark&ibp=htl;jobs&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjyqvuAgfD8AhVjHTQIHW88D1YQutcGKAF6BAgOEAU#htivrt=jobs&htidocid=FfDYOf3aqh4AAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D&fpstate=tldetail,Aarhus University (AU),Full-time,NA,Denmark,"Are you interested in astrochemistry, computational methods and machine learning? In the respective groups of Assoc. Prof. Mie Andersen and Prof. Bjørk Hammer at Department of Physics and Astronomy and Center for Interstellar Catalysis, Aarhus University, we have an open post-doctoral position within these research topics. Applications should cover aspects relevant to interstellar catalysis and grain surface chemistry.Starting Date and PeriodThe starting date is flexible. It could be around August 2023 plus/minus a few months. The duration of the employment is two years.Research area and project descriptionComplex organic molecules, e.g. sugars and amino acids, discovered in interstellar space are believed to originate from reactions taking place at nanoscale dust grain catalysts.Primarily, these grains are made up of Mg- or Fe-rich silicates or carbon-based materials. In cold and dense gas clouds, the grains are increasingly covered with ices of molecules such as water, carbon... monoxide and carbon dioxide, which may impact their reactivity.In this postdoc project, the successful applicant will develop and apply computational methods and machine learning (ML) techniques to study aspects relevant to interstellar catalysis. This could be the structure and properties of interstellar dust grains or few-layer to bulk ices that may form on these grains.Or it could be the interaction of astrochemically relevant molecules with interstellar dust grains. For example, how the formation of ices may impact the adsorption, mobility and reactivity of small molecules that may be precursors to the synthesis of larger, more complex species including biologically relevant molecules such as sugars and amino acids. The ML methods could include approaches to accelerate structure optimization through surrogate models or ML force fields as well as approaches to accelerate the calculation of adsorption energies, diffusion and reaction barriers compared to computationally costly density functional theory calculations.The project will be physically anchored at the Center for Interstellar Catalysis at Aarhus University and will take place in close collaboration with partners carrying out theoretical work, laboratory experiments and astronomical observations.Your ProfileApplicants must hold a PhD degree in physics, chemistry, nanoscience or equivalent. Previous experience with machine learning methods and/or first principles energy calculations in astrochemistry or physical chemistry is required. Experience with programming in python is highly desired.You can learn more about InterCat here, Mie Andersen’s group here and Bjørk Hammer’s group here.Place of work and area of EmploymentThe place of work is Ny Munkegade 120, 8000 Aarhus C and the area of employment is Aarhus University with related departments.Further information may be obtained by e-mailing Mie Andersen (mie@phys.au.dk) or Bjørk Hammer (hammer@phys.au.dk).
