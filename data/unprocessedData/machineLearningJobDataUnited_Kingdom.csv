One example of our tracking products is SkeleTRACK - a real-time ball and skeletal tracking currently deployed to major US sports leagues and European football leagues. Our Computer Vision and Machine Learning team are almost entirely responsible for building this technology. We are now looking at how we improve and extend this into more sports and services - more than likely solving more complex and challenging problems!

A day in the life of a Machine Learning Engineer

As a Machine Learning engineer at Hawk-Eye Innovations, you will... be part of an agile team that is responsible for the end to end pipeline for our Machine Learning models. This involves tasks such as working with our annotation teams to get the best annotated data and providing them with the best tools on our annotations platform; keeping track of live model performance and detect common failure cases; integrating models and features into our SkeleTRACK products; keeping up to date with the latest research; and designing new ML models, whether real-time or otherwise.

You will partner closely with our product team to establish requirements and develop innovative solutions to the most complex challenges within sports technology. You can expect to solve significant problems whilst leading and coaching more junior members of the team as we brainstorm solutions, conduct research and find the best approach. You will be working in a weekly Kanban cycle to deliver game-changing technology and will support the configuration and deployment of our products that are delivered on a global scale.

Key Responsibilities
We innovate to build incredible ball and player tracking solutions, applying that to sports officiating but also broadcast video, coaching and fan engagement. Computer Vision and Machine Learning is pivotal to all of this and is the core competency of the Hawk-Eye Engineering team.

You will be working with a highly skilled set of engineers. As the business and team have grown rapidly, so has the emphasis on creating a team and structure that can enable us to continue to create innovative solutions and products.
As a Senior Engineer, you will be one of the senior members of the team. Technically, you will be a developing domain expert and expected to help influence the direction of our development. Your responsibilities will include:

Closing Date: Friday 21 April 2023

Reference: ENG1630

This project employs novel machine learning techniques in order to enhance the sustainability of structures in terms of reduced resource consumption and CO2 emissions. Concrete is the most widely used construction material, its fabrication consumes a large number of natural resources (fine and coarse aggregates from sand and gravel), and the associated cement production contributes around 8% of CO2 emission. More than 4 billion tonnes of aggregate will be needed to meet UK’s construction demands between 2022 and 2035, according to the mineral product association (MPA). Solutions for more sustainable concrete have become imperative, among which replacing natural aggregates with recycled aggregates (RA) from construction and demolition wastes is encouraged. This can reduce prudent use of natural resources, maximise use of recycled construction waste along with potential for cost savings.

The... project targets a paradigm shift in using recycled aggregates in structures. Innovative structural solutions will be developed incorporating a high volume of recycled aggregates. In the project, advanced machine learning methods and techniques will be employed and adapted for modelling constitutive behaviour of confined concrete incorporating recycled aggregates. Validation for the applicability of confined concrete material will be made against their performance in concrete-steel composite structures.

This project would suit a graduate with good knowledge in Structural Engineering and the motivation and interests in sustainability of infrastructures and the solutions for net-zero. The research will be supported by the facilities at Center of structural engineering and informatics at University of Nottingham and School of Engineering at University of Birmingham.

Entry requirements:

Applicants should have, or expect to obtain, a 1st class or 2.1 honours degree in Civil Engineering. Students with experience in Matlab/Python are encouraged to apply. We require an enthusiastic graduate with a 1st class degree in engineering, computer science, maths, or a relevant discipline, at integrated Master’s level or with a relevant MSc (in exceptional circumstances a 2:1 degree can be considered).

Due to funding restrictions this position is only available for UK candidates.

However, we welcome international candidates, funding is only available for exceptional students.

Senior AI/ML Engineer – Sequence Learning

At GSK we see a world in which advanced applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) will allow us to develop novel therapies to existing diseases and to quickly respond to emerging or changing diseases with personalized drugs, driving better outcomes at reduced cost with fewer side effects. It is an ambitious vision that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of AI/ML. If that excites you, we'd love to chat.

The AI/ML Sequence Learning Team applies machine learning and AI methods to biological sequence (DNA, RNA, protein) data from large-scale human genetic, functional genomic and single cell experiments. Models operating directly on sequence data that can infer how variants alter protein/RNA abundance, structure and function have the potential to be transformative in drug discovery, empowering us to find new life... saving medicines.

We are looking for a Senior AI/ML Engineer to help us make this vision a reality. Competitive candidates will have a track record in developing state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models for solving challenging real world scientific problems. You should be an outstanding scientist with in-depth knowledge in modern machine learning.

You can independently execute and deliver full AI/ML driven solutions from sourcing training data, design and implementing SOTA machine learning models, testing, benchmarking and product driven research for model performance improvement, to shipping stable, tested, performant code and services in an agile environment.

The AI/ML team is built on the principles of ownership, accountability, continuous development, and collaboration. We hire for the long term, and we're motivated to make this a great place to work. Our leaders will be committed to your career and development from day one.

We’re combining the power of genetic and genomic insights into what causes disease, with the speed and scale of AI/ML to make better predictions about who a treatment might work for, and why. We believe this powerful combination of data and technology holds the key to fundamentally transforming medical discovery for the better, improving R&D success rates and shaping how even the most challenging diseases, like neurological conditions and cancer, can be both prevented and treated.

In 2021 we delivered four major product approvals: Cabenuva for HIV, Jemperli for endometrial cancer, Xevudy for COVID-19 and Apretude, our new long-acting medicine for HIV prevention.

In this role you will
• Use your expertise in machine learning, software engineering and genomics to lead the hands-on delivery of AI/ML-powered services and libraries
• Work closely with subject matter experts in human genetics to conceive, plan and execute novel AI/ML solutions to key drug discovery problems
• Be a standard bearer for scientific, machine learning and software engineering best practice in the organisation, constructing robust, tested, production-grade software products with well-characterised performance and limitations
• Fully participate in the scientific and engineering culture of the Sequence Learning Team, as a code reviewer, collaborator and mentor
• Continuously develop expertise in a fast-moving and intellectually challenging (but highly rewarding!) scientific space
• Exhibit excellent project management and communication skills, taking full ownership and working transparently to deliver objectives to specification and on time

When applying for this role, please use the ‘cover letter’ of the online application or your CV to describe how you meet the competencies for this role, as outlined in the job requirements above. The information that you have provided in your cover letter and CV will be used to assess your application.

During the course of your application you will be requested to complete voluntary information which will be used in monitoring the effectiveness of our equality and diversity policies.

About Us

We’re here to make money work for everyone and we're doing things differently. For too long, banking has been obtuse, complex and opaque.

We want to change that and build a bank with everyone, for everyone. Our amazing community suggests features, test the app and give us constant feedback so we can build something everyone loves.

We're focused on solving problems, rather than selling financial products. We want to make the world a better place and change people's lives through Monzo.

About Our Machine Learning, Financial Crime Team

As a Machine Learning Scientist, you’ll be working in an ever changing environment where we are building and iterating on our financial crime defence capabilities to ensure we keep Monzo and our customers safe. As a financial crime team we have a large impact on Monzo’s bottom line as fraud and scams are usually some of the largest cost line items in a bank's P&L. In addition, we have a great influence on the overall... customer experience and it’s our duty to keep them safe. Most of the work we do results in directly measurable customer or company benefit which is incredibly satisfying.

Our Machine Learning Scientists don’t have a permanent assignment to a problem space and might rotate into different financial crime areas after some time. The major problem spaces that we are working in are: fraud prevention, transaction monitoring for different types of suspicious activity, customer risk assessment and operational tooling to name the biggest ones. At the moment we are about 21 people in financial crime data, including Analytics Engineers, Data Analysts, Machine Learning Scientist and Data Scientists.

What You’ll Be Working On

As part of your job you’ll work closely with product managers, data scientists, backend engineers, designers and researchers in an agile product environment. You’ll champion the use of data and machine learning techniques, bring ideas to life through rigorous experimentation and A/B testing. You’ll help us get the most out of large volumes of data stored on a modern cloud native data platform and with spotting opportunities to make each area of financial crime work even better for our users and for Monzo.

Our culture is open and focused on collaboration between different functions and individuals. It is fast paced and innovative where we try to push the boundaries of the current financial industry best practices. We put a lot of emphasis on feedback (up, side and downwards) and personal growth and development.

Your day-to-day

You’ll be a member of the machine learning discipline, working within a product squad in financial crime to help to design, build, analyse, and experiment with machine learning systems that make use of the data we gather.

We organise our machine learning projects into three distinct phases; you'll spend your time doing all three:
• Explore . We use BigQuery and Jupyter Notebooks to analyse data and design machine learning models for offline evaluation. For example, we are investigating machine learning powered assistants for our customer operations team, classifiers to detect financial fraud or to assess customer risk at signup.
• Launch . We build Python micro services and cron jobs to put promising machine learning models into production. We are actively working on automating as much of this step as possible: our goal is for any data scientist or ML engineer to be able to deploy a promising new model to production in less than a day.
• Iterate . We run A/B tests in partnership with other teams and analyse the results. Based on outcomes, we may decide to roll the model out to every customer or to explore improvements to the model for further testing.

You Should Apply If

What we’re doing here at Monzo excites you!
• You're impact driven and excited to own the end to end journey that starts with a business problem and ends with your solution having a measurable impact in production
• You have a self-starter mindset; you proactively identify issues and opportunities and tackle them without being told to do so
• Reducing financial crime and protecting customers with data driven strategies sounds exciting to you
• You have a solid grounding in SQL and Python, are comfortable using them every day, and keen to learn Go lang which is used in many of our microservices
• You have multiple years of experience using machine learning techniques to tackle real business problems preferably in a fast moving tech company
• You are comfortable exploring potentially ambiguous business problems within a complex and rapidly growing organisation
• You're excited about the potential of machine learning and can communicate those ideas to colleagues who are not familiar with the domain
• You’re adaptable, curious and enjoy learning new technologies and ideas
Nice to haves:
• Experience from working with financial crime and regulated institutions
• You have commercial experience writing critical production code and working with microservices

The Interview Process

Our interview process involves 3 main stages We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions!
• 30 minute recruiter call
• 45 minute call with hiring manager
• 1 take home task
• 2 x 1-hour video calls with various team members

Our average process takes around 3-4 weeks but we will always work around your availability. You will have the chance to speak to our recruitment team at various points during your process but if you do have any specific questions ahead of this please contact us on tech-hiring@monzo.com

What’s In It For You

✈️ We can help you relocate to the UK

✅ We can sponsor visas

📍This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working within the UK (with ad hoc meetings in London).

⏰ We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.

📚 Learning budget of £1,000 a year for books, training courses and conferences

➕And much more, see our full list of benefits here

If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.

Equal Opportunity Statement

We are actively creating an equitable environment for every Monzonaut to thrive.

Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo.

AI/ML Engineer – Sequence Learning

At GSK we see a world in which advanced applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) will allow us to develop novel therapies to existing diseases and to quickly respond to emerging or changing diseases with personalized drugs, driving better outcomes at reduced cost with fewer side effects. It is an ambitious vision that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of AI/ML. If that excites you, we'd love to chat.

The AI/ML Sequence Learning Team applies machine learning and AI methods to biological sequence (DNA, RNA, protein) data from large-scale human genetic, functional genomic and single cell experiments. Models operating directly on sequence data that can infer how variants alter protein/RNA abundance, structure and function have the potential to be transformative in drug discovery, empowering us to find new life... saving medicines.

We're looking for a highly accomplished AI/ML Engineer to help us make this vision a reality. Competitive candidates will have a track record of shipping high performing AI/ML powered products in production environments. They are highly accomplished Machine Learning Engineers, with breadth across machine learning methods, as well as depth in at least one area. Additionally, they are accomplished software engineers with a track record of shipping stable, tested, performant code and services in an agile environment.

Strong candidates will have graduate studies in computer science, applied mathematics, or the equivalent, and a passion for solving challenging problems in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Educational or professional background in the biological sciences is a plus; passion to help therapies for new and existing diseases, and a pattern of continuous learning and development is mandatory.

The AI/ML team is built on the principles of ownership, accountability, continuous development, and collaboration. We hire for the long term, and we're motivated to make this a great place to work. Our leaders will be committed to your career and development from day one.

We’re combining the power of genetic and genomic insights into what causes disease, with the speed and scale of AI/ML to make better predictions about who a treatment might work for, and why. We believe this powerful combination of data and technology holds the key to fundamentally transforming medical discovery for the better, improving R&D success rates and shaping how even the most challenging diseases, like neurological conditions and cancer, can be both prevented and treated.

In 2021 we delivered four major product approvals: Cabenuva for HIV, Jemperli for endometrial cancer, Xevudy for COVID-19 and Apretude, our new long-acting medicine for HIV prevention.
