The College of Engineering...
at the University of Georgia is seeking to grow and
diversify its programs through investments in faculty with
expertise in advanced signal processing and artificial intelligence
as it applies to the research and scholarship in Cyber-Physical
Systems, including but not limited to power and health
systems.

The College invites applications for multiple open
rank, 9-month tenured or tenure-track faculty positions in
Advanced Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence in
Cyber-Physical Systems at the Assistant, Associate or Full
Professor rank. These positions seek to identify highly qualified
candidates with expertise at the intersection of data science and
artificial intelligence with Cyber-Physical Systems and Security,
in particular IoT, power and control systems, healthcare systems,
zero-trust and web 3.0. We particularly look for strong candidates
with fundamental and applied research on these two areas: (a)
Advanced Signal Processing, (b) Explainable Deep Learning with
Domain Generalization. This position will be centered in the
College of Engineering’s School of Electrical and
Computer Engineering ( ECE ) and will be supervised by the
School Chair.

These positions will start on August 1, 2023, and are academic-year
appointments (9 months) with an opportunity to supplement salary
during the summer.

This is multi-year effort at the College level; school appointments
will be made based on area of expertise in consultation with the
appropriate School Chair and Dean.

The new faculty members are expected to develop a vigorous,
high-impact, externally funded research program; work closely with
other members of the cluster hire and existing faculty; effectively
mentor graduate students and postdoctoral scientists; effectively
support our teaching mission at the undergraduate and graduate
levels; and contribute to a diverse and inclusive environment
within the university.

This is part of a major, campus-wide Presidential hiring initiative
in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence that aims to recruit 50
faculty members who will educate students and advance research in
data science and AI over the next two years. Rather than being
housed exclusively in a single department, however, the majority of
UGA’s newly recruited faculty will focus on the fusion of data
science and AI in cross-cutting areas such as infectious diseases,
integrative precision agriculture, ethics, cybersecurity, resilient
communities and the environment.

The College of Engineering already has significant expertise in the
areas of Cyber-Physical Systems, Embedded Systems,
Internet-of-Things, Machine and Deep Learning Applications.
Examples are the interdisciplinary team of researchers and
educators in the School of Electrical
& Computer Engineering and colleagues affiliated with
the recently established Center for
Cyber-Physical Systems , as well as with other departments
and institutes within and outside the College of Engineering. The
College of Engineering creates an ideal environment for candidates
looking to explore security and resilience issues in Embedded
Systems, IoT and CPS, which include but are not limited to AI-based
decision making, robotics, smart grids, access control and
cybersecurity, smart infrastructure and agriculture, medical/health
data analytics and infection diseases dynamic monitoring and
prediction.

The UGA College of Engineering will utilize this initiative to
demonstrate our commitment to diversifying our faculty and ensuring
that we maintain and grow the culture of equity and inclusivity
present in our College. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core
values of the University and the College of Engineering’s
Strategic Plan, and this hiring initiative will make use
of the best practices to ensure an inclusive search process. The
Diversity
and Inclusion Plan for the College of Engineering
identifies priority areas for our investments and through the
2022-2023 academic year we are working to finalize a Diversity
and Inclusive Excellence Plan . The College offers
structured mentoring programs for all faculty that support
professional development. Several programs exist to enhance the
inclusiveness of our College, including a student-led Engineering
Equity Council and facilitated dialogue that promotes
discourse on topics in diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Faculty hired as part of this initiative will join a
rapidly-growing College of Engineering that combines
interdisciplinary research and scholarship with excellent
instruction and service. The UGA College of Engineering currently
enrolls over 4,000 engineering majors and has over 125 full-time
faculty across 15 degree programs. The College of Engineering is
comprised for four interdisciplinary schools: The School of
Environmental, Civil, Agricultural, and Mechanical
Engineering , The School of
Electrical and Computer Engineering , The School of Chemical, Materials, and
Biomedical Engineering , and The School of Computing —
an innovative joint program shared with Franklin College of Arts
and Sciences which launched this year.

Significant investments in infrastructure have resulted in an
expansion of laboratory
facilities for research and scholarship and new classrooms
and instructional labs. College of Engineering faculty will have
space in two major capital projects on campus to create
interdisciplinary research facilities. Our main instructional
facility, Driftmier
Engineering Center , has also undergone complete renovation
to create flexible classrooms that enable a range of teaching
modalities and the incorporation of interdisciplinary instructional
labs. The common instructional facilities also foster diversity by
allowing faculty, staff, and students to interact and collaborate
in a single facility.

Emory University is a leading research university that fosters excellence and attracts world-class talent to innovate today and prepare leaders for the future. We welcome candidates who can contribute to the diversity and excellence of our academic community...
Description:

We at the HITI (Healthcare Innovations and Translational Informatics) lab pride ourselves in working collaboratively with multiple researchers to bring innovation into healthcare. Our broad themes of work are on datasets curation, testing of machine learning models, developing AI models for computer vision and natural language processing, and exploring fairness, explainability and bias of algorithms. With 6 core faculty in radiology , perception/psychology studies and computer science, we push the boundaries of our research work to ensure we support the AI ecosystem to grow and develop AI products that are clinically useful.

For example, we are curating a large diverse mammographic dataset of 100,000 patients that has imaging, pathology and clinical outcomes for AI model development and inference. We are developing a fusion model combining EHR data and imaging data for COVID-19 management, and are translating the models into clinical care for triage. We are also curating a large dataset for hepatocellular carcinoma using semantic labeling across multiple institutions. We are an implementing center for the American College of Radiology ACR AI lab, which provides a platform to perform federated learning across multiple sites in the USA. We are also a core research center for the newly funded MIDRC initiative to curate large ML datasets with RSNA and ACR.

Our work with Georgia Tech with Dr Mark Riedl is pushing the application of socio technical approach to AI explainability, allowing us to prioritize human values in the design of AI systems. Working with Dr Ayer Turgay from Georgia Tech, we are analyzing large datasets to advance operations research and policy work like trauma care in the USA. With Dr Purkayastha from Indiana University we are funded by the NSF to explore the future of work, and are applying the concept of machine teaching with assemblage learning to explore the future of work augmented with AI systems. With Dr Lungren and the Stanford AIMI lab we provide an opportunity for frequent conversations on current AI topics, as we work together on joint dataset curation and global health informatics. With Dr Leo Celi from MIT we are pushing the boundaries where we use our expertise to assess bias in clinical systems and look at trust and the healthcare experience for patients. As we survive 2 pandemics , one for COVID and another for systemic racism, we have refocused our efforts on studying bias in algorithms, and are excited for our collaborations with Dr Ziad Obermeyer to get better algorithmic measures that reduce bias in AI algorithms.

We are seeking a highly motivated Ph.D./postdoc candidate to work in one of the following areas of Artificial Intelligence/Machine
• Computer Vision in Radiology imaging.
• Natural language processing in Radiology reports and clinical notes
• Learning for Healthcare:
• Human-machine interaction for decision making
• Use of knowledge representation and data curation for ML in Healthcare

We look favorably on applicants who can demonstrate a knowledge of computer vision, machine learning, data curation using semantic web, ontologies, knowledge graphs, and who have strong programming and mathematical skills.

So what are we going to do for you ? Our commitment to you is to provide you an opportunity for meaningful work , a clear path to mentorship, freedom to work on some personal projects of interest (as long as your code is saving lives), and to have the pleasure of working in a respectful environment where you are supported to be your best. We love open source, and hence you will get to interact with students from all over the world and offer your guidance to nurture the future generation of learners.

Our team consists of creative, open minded, caring and entrepreneurial individuals from all walks of life. We aspire to build incredible things which starts with building an incredible team, so we’d love to hear from you! 😄

About The Role 🎉

We’re building a next-generation creative tool that enables a new level of interactivity with cloud-based machine learning models. For our tool to be maximally expressive, we’re working to establish a seamless feedback loop between our users and the machine learning models powering our abilities. It’s not sufficient for our models to be accurate; nor is it enough for our user interface to be beautiful and responsive; we need to ensure that the link between the two is as fast and reliable as possible.

For this reason, we’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can help us create the server-side engine that powers our interactive tools for image and video synthesis. You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments. We’re looking for someone who is deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems design, and has extensive experience building web-based real-time server applications.

A peek at our technical stack 🔍

The rich UI of our video editing and collaboration tools is powered by Typescript and React/Redux, while the real time compositing and graphics engine behind our interactive preview runs on WebGL2 and WebAssembly. Our video streaming backend components are written in Python, use a lot of FFmpeg/libav and HLS for on-the-fly transcoding, PyTorch and TorchScript for ML inference, and are deployed as containerized services on Kubernetes. Our API endpoints for real-time collaboration and media asset management are written in Typescript and node.js and are deployed as serverless functions on AWS Lambda.

What You’ll Do 🎨
• Work with a world-class engineering team pushing the boundaries of content creation on the browser
• Collaborate with our research team to deploy state-of-the-art computer vision models to production
• Improve the performance and efficiency of our machine learning deployments

What You’ll Need 💻
• Solid knowledge of at least one machine learning research framework (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow), and at least one high-performance inference framework (e.g. TensorRT, Apache TVM)
• Experience profiling and optimizing deep neural networks, including knowledge of GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight
• Familiarity with Python-based image and video manipulation/encoding/decoding frameworks, such as OpenCV and PyAV
• Experience with cloud orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure
• Ability to write robust and maintainable client-server architectures and APIs
• Ability to rapidly prototype solutions and iterate on them with tight product deadlines
• Strong communication, collaboration, and documentation skills

We strives to recruit and retain exceptional talent from diverse backgrounds while ensuring pay equity for our team. Our salary ranges are based on competitive market rates for our size, stage and industry, and salary is just one part of the overall compensation package we provide.

There are many factors that go into salary determinations, including relevant experience, skill level and qualifications assessed during the interview process, and maintaining internal equity with peers on the team. The range shared below is a general expectation for the function as posted, but we are also open to considering candidates who may be more or less experienced than outlined in the job description. In this case, we will communicate any updates in the expected salary range.

Lastly, the provided range is the expected salary for candidates in the U.S. Outside of those regions, there may be a change in the range, which again, will be communicated to candidates.

Working Here   

We are a small and growing team of artists, engineers, researchers, and dreamers working together to reimagine creativity. And we’re building a unique team of talented individuals from diverse backgrounds. We believe that this will allow us to continue to up-level each other, our company, and our product. We’re looking for people that will add to our culture, not just fit in.

We’re committed to creating a space where our employees can bring their full selves to work and have equal opportunity to succeed. So regardless of race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, origin, ability, age, veteran status, if joining this mission speaks to you, we encourage you to apply!
