Keywords: Open-source, viral licensing, machine learning

Duration: 6-month internship

This internship can be done in France (Meudon) or India (Bangalore)

About CAST

CAST is the market leader in Software Intelligence. Its unique technology thoroughly examines the structure of complex software systems, with MRI-like precision. It delivers accurate, actionable, and automated views of software architecture, critical flaws, quality grades, sizing metrics, open-source usage, and cloud readiness levels. Hundreds of companies rely on CAST for greater objectivity in crucial business decisions, faster application modernization for Cloud, raising the quality and security of their custom software.

Founded more than 25 years ago and backed by nearly $200 million in R&D, CAST’s rapid analysis technology and its advanced ‘MRI for Software’ drive IT transformation and enable automation at the world’s largest systems... integrators, hundreds of Global 2000 enterprises, and government agencies, in North America, Europe, India and in China.

CAST provides two sets of products of different technologies, implementation models, and usage:

CAST Highlight is a SaaS product capable of performing rapid application portfolio analysis. It analyzes source code of applications to measure their cloud readiness, to analyze their composition, resiliency, and technical debt.

CAST Imaging on the other hand is an on-premises product that can run for reverse-engineers all database structures, code components, and interdependencies in custom-built applications. It provides interactive and accurate architecture blueprints, data-call graphs, and end-to-end transaction flows.

Context

The use of open-source libraries and frameworks leads to more and more dependencies on open-source components, this eventually creates an invisible layer of code that is difficult to trace permanently.

From a list of predefined roles of open-source components, we need to classify open-source components at package level but also at method level.

This classification is needed by CAST imaging to better classify internal code and to see which part does what. For example, access to databases or a call to an authentication API or a call to a web service, or a call to a cloud service.

Proposed work

The objective of the internship is to train models in order to determine the role of an open-source component at component level, class level and method level.

We already have tested some ML approaches by analyzing source code of open-source components from GitHub.

The main objective of the project will therefore be:
• Build a set of GitHub projects having a given role
• Create different models per role using source code available under Github
• Try another approach using online documentation of given component
• Set up an unsupervised functional classification method for these OS modules

Team

In CAST, The R&D team is more than 100 people divided between France and India. Organized by many teams and all coordinated by the R&D director. The majority of team leader are based in our French headquarter in Meudon.

For this internship, the intern will essentially work with the R&D director, R&D architect and product managers managing Analyzers and Imaging team.

Working with Imaging, CAST R&D team means being an important part of a highly talented, fast-paced, multicultural, and Agile team based in Paris (France) and Bangalore (India).

The team builds architecture, visualization using sophisticated source code analysis platform leveraging parsing, control flow, data flow, and other mechanisms to fully understand the inner structure of the complex IT Systems developed and used by Fortune 500 companies.

We want to radically improve how we humans communicate with each other. Our first step at Ava is to empower 450M deaf and hard-of-hearing people to live in a fully accessible world.

Every day, millions of people are excluded from conversations because they cannot hear what others say well. Our CEO Thibault grew up in a Deaf family & witnessed firsthand how the world was not accessible for them. Together with our CTO Skinner — deaf since age 2 — Thibault co-founded Ava to make live captioning of conversations as easy as turning on captions on TV.

Our small but fast-growing team has reinvented AI-based speech recognition technology to be in service of people who need it the most. We dream of a 24/7 accessible world, without any communication barrier.

In this pursuit, we're seeing how critical communication skills are, yet very far from ideal, to unleash our collective potential. This is for us the last barrier to be lifted.

Our belief is that... well-designed technology can help everyone communicate and connect better — much more effectively and authentically — so humanity can achieve the greatest things together.

We want to make the seemingly impossible equation of collaboration 1 + 1 = 3, work every time. In other words, make 1 & 1 = 3 a reality.

Description du poste

What you'll be doing:

The core of your mission will be to reinvent what voice recognition can do to understand real-world conversations: crack the cocktail-party problem.

The signal is acquired via an array of ad-hoc microphones, and is processed to guess who says what, using a set of techniques: source localization, voice recognition, microphone calibration, speech recognition, source separation… all in real-time.

What we offer:
• An opportunity to apply cutting-edge technologies to solve real world problems, right now.
• Empowering and fast-paced working environment.
• Competitive salary and equity opportunity.
• The job will be based in our Paris office.

Qualifications
• You have > 3 years of research experience in Machine Learning (including Deep Learning).
• Experience in Speaker Identification, ASR, NLP, acoustic modeling, language models or source separation is a plus.
• You ambition to be a pioneer in the field, and do what is necessary to make things work in real world situations.
• You're of the persistent, yet open-minded and collaborative type: you reason by independent thinking first, but you know that together, we're stronger.

Job description

As a Machine Learning research intern at Joko, you will work on the automatic analysis of web pages, which is central for many core features of the smart web browser (and of the smart browser extensions) that we are currently building. For instance, your work will be key to delivering functionalities such as price tracking, product comparison, or universal one-click purchase on any e-commerce website, independently of specific website designs. Your work will also lay down the foundations of a radically new type of web browser, able to recognize and transform elements in real time on any website, in order to offer a unified and smooth shopping experience to our users.

You will typically work on the following problems:

Webpage classification: to detect if a webpage is a checkout page, a basket page, a product page for instance.

Webpage element classification: typically to identify web page elements such as prices, product images, user reviews, product descriptions, product features, credit card fields, shipping details forms, etc.

Automatization of user journeys: for instance, to automatically complete a checkout flow on behalf of the user.

Solving these problems requires digging deep into how webpages are transformed and rendered by web browsers, and find the right level of abstraction for the algorithms. In particular, you will work on the DOM structure (Document Object Model), which is a tree data structure that plays a central role in the functioning of web browsers. As the DOM is a tree, it can typically be leveraged through graph neural networks. But as it also contains very rich text and image data, these graph algorithms can be combined with NLP and Computer Vision algorithms to achieve maximum performance. You will also work on real-time inference and the embedding of your algorithms on devices with limited CPU and memory.

The literature on these subjects is still in its infancy, and exploration will represent an important part of the internship, through experiments, literature reviews, and theoretical developments. You will have full ownership of your projects, and the liberty to orient the research direction of your internship based on your results and what you consider promising amongst directions we determined.

You will work closely with the engineering team that will be here to help you integrate coding best practices into your research, and to give you an insider look into modern software development. You will also have the possibility to integrate some of the algorithms you designed into our product, and monitor their impacts on hundreds of thousands of users.

Your responsibilities:

Research: You will work on all steps of the research process – you will formalize the objectives of your work, conduct literature reviews to have a deep understanding of the problems, design new algorithms, analyze them both theoretically and experimentally, and collect and transform relevant data for your experiments.

Exploration & ownership: You will participate in orienting the internship towards research directions you deem valuable to our users.

Implementation, deployment & monitoring in production: Helped by the engineering team, you will be responsible for integrating into our product the most scalable and robust algorithms you will have worked on. Finally, you will monitor their impact on our users.

Processes: You will help improve our R&D tools, processes, and organization.

Preferred experience

Problem solver: You have strong analytical skills, you are creative, and you love solving complex problems.

Fast learner: You are comfortable in any technical environment and are able to quickly learn new technologies and new practices.

Programming skills: You have experience with writing code and are willing to improve on it. You have experience with Python and Python Machine Learning frameworks.

Attention to details: You know that the devil is in the details, and you have talent for spotting flaws when they exist.

Tech savvy: You are constantly looking at emerging technologies and you keep a close eye on the latest trends in the domain.

Efficiency: You are fond of productivity tools and able to deliver on time on projects with many stakeholders.

Mindset: You have an entrepreneurial mindset, you like challenges, you welcome feedback and you are willing to get better every day to reach excellence.

Communication: You have strong written and verbal communication skills, and you are able to explain something complex with simple words.

Languages: You are fluent in English both written and spoken, as we are expanding internationally soon. Mastering French is not required.

Education: You are a graduate student in a Machine Learning master.

Nice to have:

You have experience with research, from past internships or projects

You have knowledge in web automation and/or in web browser development

We are working on the creation of autonomous agents capable of high-level visual reasoning and solving tasks requiring navigation in an unknown environment, such as a building, an apartment. Our current methodology addresses this problem in an ""Active Neural SLAM"" mode, i.e. no pre-existing maps or representations are required, the agents builds maps on the fly. These maps are metric and contain different content: occupancy, semantics, and latent representations, which are learned from different signals like RL, IL, SSL etc. These maps are used by different motion planners, symbolic and learned.

While the advantage of this solution is the flexibility and speed with which it can be deployed (no 3D scans, adaptation or fine-tuning are required), it has also several drawbacks. Most importantly, existing 3D scans (if available... contain valuable information, which can significantly improve navigation performance and robustness of the algorithms. Secondly, the meta-data available with these maps integrates well with the downstream application and user interface, as they can make it easier for humans to provide navigation goals.

The purpose of this internship is to adapt our models to allow an agent to also use existing maps from different origins: 3D scans / SfM, or explorative rollouts from an agent prior to the main episodes (Lidar scans). They can be of various forms, including 3D meshes, 3D point clouds, 2D occupancy grids, or latent point clouds (R2D2 keypoints). The goal is to dynamically align these static representations with the ones which are dynamically estimated by the robot and to exploit them for navigation. The candidate will carry out research and development activities to achieve important milestones toward this goal:
• Understanding the existing navigation methodology developed at NAVER LABS Europe
• Pre-processing of (already available) maps and scans
• Development of algorithms, which dynamically align these data with the dynamic maps collected and estimated by the agent itself
• Exploiting the combined data in a hybrid navigation algorithm

The successful candidate should be enrolled in a graduate program, at the Master or PhD level.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do -you can't put us in a box

But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us.

We recognize that diverse teams make the strongest teams, and we encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.

Your role is to carry out a post-doc on : ""Ethics of AI in federated learning

Europe defends responsible AI and published in mid-April 2021 the ""AI act"" [2] aimed at legislating on high-risk AI. Societal concerns about discrimination, privacy, transparency, explainability and the responsibility of data scientists and companies are growing [3]. At the same time, technology continues to improve the performance and accuracy of models. More particularly, federated learning [4] allows to respond to concerns about privacy/confidentiality between different actors. However, at the same time, it raises complex and new ethical problems especially in the case of federated learning involving several companies willing to train a common model (cross-silo federated learning) among which fair participation of all [5]. Finally in France from 2022, mobile operators and internet service providers will have to indicate the carbon impact of their customers' digital activities and... artificial intelligence is a significant element to take into account.

The objective of the post-doc is to propose and develop tools allowing the development of cross-silo federated AI models that are above all fair and have a low carbon footprint. You will tackle the problem of fairness due to training data [4] [2] [3] and the mechanism of training a model [4] [5] [6]. You will also focus on making models explainable and less energy consuming [11][12].

By taking as a framework the generic use case of a high-risk AI and taking into account the specificities related to cross-silo federated learning , you will propose tools (KPI and alert system) to report any potential bias and minimize the carbon footprint of the system as a whole (indicators and warning system on all components).

planning

Months 1 and 2: State of the art on tools for fairness, and for measuring environmental sustainability. A capitalization will be made on the monitoring carried out by Orange experts on federated learning and ethics.

Months 3 to 7: In the case of AI use involving different companies, propose indicators to measure the achievement of the objectives in terms of fairness and environmental sustainability. If time allows, also look at ways to make these AI systems explainable.

Months 8 to 11: Build indicators and develop an alert system in the event of risk of bias and also environmental unsustainability.

Month 12: Communication and publication.

about you

Personal qualities desired by the position.

You have very good knowledge of AI model development and particularly in federated learning / deep learning, edge intelligence.

You are ethically sensitive.

You are autonomous and take initiatives.

You appreciate teamwork.

Applications to thoracic aorta diseasesThis 18-month post-doctoral position is funded within the framework of the TAAMOD project: Thoracic Aorta Aneurysm MODeling, winner of the A*MIDEX 2021 Interdisciplinarity call for projects.This project is supported by a multidisciplinary consortium made up of researchers specializing in fluid mechanics, biomechanics, porous media, statistics, as well as medical imaging. The biomechanics team of the Institute for Research on Non-Equilibrium Phenomena (UMR7342, Marseille), the physical transfer team of IUSTI (UMR7343, Marseille), the econometric and statistics team of AMSE (UMR7316, Marseille... the cardio vascular system team of CRMBM (UMR7339 Marseille) and in collaboration with the vascular surgery and medical imaging departments of la Timone Hospital want to develop a clinical diagnostic tool capable of early prediction of the development of pathologies of the thoracic aorta.The criteria usually used in clinical routine to evaluate the evolution of some of these pathologies such as aneurysms and/or dissections are, indeed, not sufficiently discriminating to predict early the best medical or surgical treatment. This project aims to determine, through numerical modelling and deep learning techniques, which physical parameters are likely to be correlated with an unfavourable evolution, and thus improve the management of patients.The IRPHE biomechanics team carries out complex digital modeling of some of these pathologies using data from medical imaging -CT scan for geometries and MRI (2D+t, 3D+t, cine dynamic) for boundary conditions. The objective is to implement patient-specific 3D models considering fluid and structure features for different types of evolution - favorable and unfavorable - as well as for several postoperative times. This makes it possible to associate physical quantities linked to the dynamics of flow and structures with certain unfavorable clinical evolutions ([1]) and, subsequently, to predict certain treatment failures at an early stage. However, the computation time associated with these complex models constitutes an obstacle to their use in clinical practice.The main objective of this post-doctoral project is therefore to implement deep learning techniques to replace these numerical models to predict early the evolution of thoracic aortic pathologies. Aneurysms and/or dissections of the thoracic aorta will be studied. Indeed, the biomechanics team of IRPHE (V. Deplano) has already performed numerical modelling of aortic dissections ([2], [3]) and is currently working on biomimetic numerical modelling of thoracic aortic aneurysms ([4]). Clinical data are obtained thanks to collaborations with the vascular surgery (M. Gaudry & M. De Masi) and imaging (A. Jacquier) departments of the Timone Hospital. MRI sequences allowing the integration of patient specific boundary conditions are implemented in collaboration with the CRMBM (S. Rapacchi). In addition, in collaboration with IUSTI (J. Vicente), the biomechanics team of IRPHE is also develop in vitro experiments on porous biological media to model the behavior of thrombus that appears during aneurysm formation ([5]). B. Ghattas (AMSE) uses and develops statistical learning and deep learning approaches for medical applications. In particular, he has already developed algorithms for automatic segmentation and modeling of medical images based on deep neural networks ([6]). He will be involved in the deployment of these methods dedicated to engineering science problems such as those encountered in the numerical modeling of fluid flows and vascular diseases [[7], [8], [9] ].ReferencesDeplano, V. & Guivier−Curien, C.

As AI becomes an increasingly pervasive part of everyday life, it’s also incumbent upon businesses to ensure that their modelling practices are responsible, taking care to avoid propagating societal biases and inequities.

Today Dataiku provides extensive features to analyze a model’s behaviour (explaining individual predictions, as well as in aggregate at the model level), and also segment these analyses for comparison by subpopulation, and against various measures of fairness. However we believe there remains an opportunity to do more, and empower our users with more capabilities to deliver transparent and robust models, by further improving our explainability suite, and also providing more ways to interrogate & mitigate unwanted bias throughout the model development lifecycle.

The objective of the internship... is to add additional capabilities to our interpretability and responsibility suite of functionalities.

During this internship, you will:
• Get familiar with Dataiku, its machine learning capabilities, model explanation & responsible AI techniques, the D3.js and ECharts libraries…
• Propose other possible enhancements and help prioritize the various enhancements.
• Implement one or more enhancements, starting with the most important ones first.

Celebrate and party because our beloved users can now enjoy even more insights into their models!

Dataiku focuses on Enterprise Software, Analytics, Machine Learning, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence. Their company has offices in New York City, New York, Denver, Dubai, and Singapore. They have a very large team that's between 1001-5000 employees. To date, Dataiku has raised $837.29M of funding; their latest round was closed on December 2022.

Description:

Imbalanced datasets with long-tailed distributions are widely spread in real-world scenarios including datasets acquired with remote sensing technologies in various geological settings. When used in classification tasks they cause a bias in a decision boundary for machine learning and deep learning-based solutions, resulting in a smaller feature space for rare classes. In this internship project, we aim to conduct a comparative study of balancing techniques to address this challenge.

Computer vision datasets with ultrasonic, electromagnetic and microscope borehole images have been already collected internally and from publicly available sources and will be available within the scope of this internship. This will enable us to explore the application of different balancing techniques including off-line data manipulation methods (over-sampling / under-sampling, stratified splits), cost function weighting and especially recently proposed plug-and-play approaches (on-line rare class samples generation, on-line pseudo-labels generation, etc).

The main goal of this internship is to build a cumulative foundation of techniques devoted to enable vision-based deep learning models to efficiently discover structure within datasets with imbalanced data distribution and generalize well to infrequent classes. This has a wide application benefiting well integrity and well construction projects across SLB.

Required skills:

General: applied mathematics, probability & statistics, image processing, image classification and segmentation, deep learning models like CNNs, Siamese Networks, Autoencoders

Programming: Python, PyTorch or Keras/Tensorflow

Within the framework of a collaboration between the Comité de Champagne, Segula Technologies company, and the University of Reims, we are looking to optimize the detection of the presence of vine diseases by developing and integrating imaging and machine learning concepts. This project includes several axes in which 2 PhD students participate and several master internships together with 3 (associate) professors. In this context we are recruiting a PostDoc for 18 months, extendable to 36 months, to complete the team.

Subject
The flavescence dorée, a serious and epidemic disease, is one of the two grapevines yellow diseases that might cause a rapid decay in Champagne and other wine regions, being considered as the new phylloxera of the vineyard. To date, the detection approach of the yellows is to collectively explore the vineyard on foot every year to identify affected vines and to perform biomolecular tests by approved laboratories. As the survey is not precise... nor optimal enough for a large-scale monitoring, the development and integration of detection solutions based on imagery appear necessary.
We conducted several acquisition campaigns between 2019 and 2022 under controlled and in situ conditions. New CNN-based hierarchical architectures developed by our lab have proven to be efficient on separate data sets composed of multispectral images. But the generalization capabilities of these models are not sufficient to compensate for the variability induced by endogenous and exogenous factors. The objective is to propose new detection strategies for grapevine yellows that are more robust to this variability. Several tracks could be explored, including, but not limited to:
•Fusion of multispectral images through vegetation indices to be defined and used within adapted Deep Learning architectures
•Fusion of features extracted with heterogeneous Deep Learning models from multispectral images
•Identification of an optimal subset of multispectral images and development of reinforcement or continuous learning approaches
It might also be interesting to design semi-supervised approaches to take advantage of the possibility of acquiring many unlabeled images during new acquisition campaigns to which the Postdoc will be associated.

Location
The PostDoc will be based at the CReSTIC lab of the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne on the Moulin de la Housse campus in Reims. Within the framework of the project, he/she may be required to intervene to the project partners, the Comité de Champagne in Epernay or Segula Technologies in Reims downtown.

The main objective of... this internship is to study different graph embedding techniques in the application to transportation graphs.

Navigation in transportation networks (highways, railroads) is a complex problem that can be approached with Reinforcement Learning. Practice shows that the performance of RL algorithms in this task depends heavily on how the agent perceives the transportation graph. Current approaches rely on hand-engineered features in the observation which could limit the performance of the models.

To address this issue, we propose to use graph embeddings to obtain a better representation of graph structure. By definition, graph embedding is a projection of graph elements into low-dimensional space which preserves information about the graph topology. Currently, there is a wide range of graph embedding techniques, and we need to select the one which performs best for this particular task.

This internship is a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies and contribute to a real-world project. We are looking for a motivated and talented intern to join our team and help us make the future of railway transportation closer.

The Intern must accomplish the following:
• Review the literature on various Graph Embedding techniques.
• Determine the best approaches for particular navigation task
• Implement and test several model on synthetic and real-world railway infrastructures
• Document and report your progress and results

Requirements:
• Currently enrolled in a M.S./Ph.D. program in computer science, applied mathematics, physics, or a related field
• Knowledge of Deep Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Reinforcement learning
• Experience using deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow and/or Keras, Jax

The research Our group develops new quantum photonic techniques to study a range of topics, from fundamental issues in quantum theory, up to more technologically inspired goals such as creating large entangled states of photons for applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography and quantum information.
Recently, we have focused on to integrated active elements into our experiments to provide additional flexibility.

We have projects available on the following topics: 1) The generation of multi-photon states using solid-state quantum dot sources.

We work with two quantum dot sources at ~1550 nm and ~900 nm, using active demultiplexing schemes to interfere successively emitted photons from the same quantum dot.
2) Quantum information and foundations.

We perform table-top experiments to implement... new quantum information protocols and to test some of the more counter-intuitive predictions of quantum theory.

For example, we develop efficient techniques to characterize quantum resources, create superpositions of different causal orders, and test alternative formulations of quantum mechanics.
3) Quantum machine learning.

We are developing new quantum machine learning algorithms which are tailored for our photonic quantum hardware, including our recently demonstrated quantum memristor.
These experiments are implemented using integrated waveguides. 4) Nonlinear plasmonics. Weak optical nonlinearities hamper many photonic applications.

For this reason, we use plasmonic excitations in various 2D materials (such as graphene, crystalline metals, and transition metal dichalocogenides) to enhance nonlinear processes.

Background : Over the past 10 years, technological advances in digital pathology and DNA sequencing have enabled the generation of large amounts of histological images and genomic data. In the field of oncology, these data are now of great value for diagnosing cancers, identifying their molecular subtypes and guiding the therapeutic decision. Artificial intelligence methods, and in particular those based on Deep Learning, have recently enabled great advances in the analysis of this data. The usual implementation of these methods is done from large data sets located on a centralized storage space connected to high-performance computing nodes. However, the transfer of these large volumes of sensitive patient data, produced in hospitals, in centralized spaces, outside of hospitals, is associated with several difficulties. Indeed, the large volume of this
data as well as the new General Data Protection Regulation, established at European level to protect and... control the use of this sensitive patient data, pose challenges related to data security and energy consumption. To try to overcome these difficulties, distributed (or federated) deep learning strategies have been developed in recent years. They make it possible to keep sensitive patient data in their places of production and to transfer in a centralized space only the parameters which are used to train the predictive models. The performance of this distributed strategy has so far been demonstrated on simulated data, on use cases conventionally used to test methods (e.g. MNIST data), but not on histological imaging or genomic patient data.

Objective : This project aims to study the performance of Deep Learning models trained in distributed (federated) mode compared to that obtained by these same models trained in centralized mode. This work will be carried out in collaboration with researchers from the European KATY project on personalized medicine (https://katy-).

Host laboratory: The engineer will be hosted in the ""Genetics and Chemogenomics"" team of the Interdisciplinary Research Institute of Grenoble (IRIG) of the CEA Grenoble. He/she will be co-supervised by Christophe Battail (IRIG, CEA Grenoble), expert in computational analysis and modeling of genomic data, and by Stéphane Gazut (DM2I/LIST, CEA Saclay), expert in Deep Learning methods. He/she will evolve in a multidisciplinary research environment composed of AI-experts, bioinformaticians and biologists. The engineer will also interact with developers and researchers from the European KATY project.

Profil du candidat

Candidate profile:
Technical skills: Big Data architecture (Hadoop), AI/ML/DL algorithms, unix command line and Python programming. Professional aptitude: curiosity and desire to improve their scientific and technological skills, rigor and organization, and ability to work in a team and interact with other students, engineers and researchers.

Workplan : The engineer will work on two use cases whose data is already available and collected. In the first use case, he/she will start from a Deep Learning model already developed, and trained in centralized mode, to segment histological images of cancers in order to locate and quantify different cell populations of interest. He/she will implement a distributed (federated) version of this Deep learning model and evaluate its performance against the one trained in centralized mode. In the second use case, the engineer will work from patient transcriptomic data associated with clinical metadata. He/she will contribute to the development of a Deep learning model to predict the response of patients to drug treatments based on the genetic characteristics of their cancers. He/she will then compare the performance of this algorithm when trained in centralized or distributed mode.

In line with the CEA's commitment to the integration of people with disabilities, this application is open to all.

In the BioAI group at InstaDeep, we advance healthcare and push the boundaries of medical science through a combination of expertise in biology and machine learning. We have launched a portfolio of initiatives across drug discovery and design as well as protein engineering, including efforts targeted specifically at the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While most SARS-CoV-2 variants do not impact the course of the pandemic, some variants pose significantly increased risk. Early detection of such high risk variants is paramount for proper management of the pandemic. Therefore, in a collaboration with BioNTech, we have built an Early Warning System (EWS) which leverages protein structure modelling and large protein transformer language models to monitor and evaluate new variants in near real-time.

In collaboration with research engineers and computational biologists from the BioAI Group and the EWS team, you will be contributing to the development of new approaches in... molecular modelling, protein design and other related domains, by applying your technical skills. You will be responsible for writing high-quality, maintainable, well documented, tested and modular software libraries. You will understand the underlying bioinformatics problems related to the EWS and collaborate with a multi-functional team to ensure continuous improvement and maintenance of the existing libraries in terms of code quality, test coverage and documentation to deliver proof of concepts, minimum viable products, and commercial deployment of the solutions.
