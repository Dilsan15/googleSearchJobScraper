First-and-Foremost

Before you dive-in exploring this opportunity and press Apply, we wish you to evaluate yourself - We are looking for right candidate, not the best candidate. We love to work with someone who can mandatorily gel with our vision, beliefs, thoughts, methods, and values --- which are aligned with what can be expected in a true startup with ambitious goals.

Skills are always secondary to us. Primarily, you must be someone who is not essentially looking for a job or career, rather starving for a challenge, you yourself probably don't know since when.

A book can be written on what an applicant must have before joining a . For brevity, in nutshell, we need these three in you:

1. You must be [super sharp] (Just an analogue, but Irodov, Mensa, Feynman, Polya, ACM, NIPS, ICAAC, BattleCode, DOTA etc should have been your Done stuff. Can you relate solution 1 to problem 2? or Do you get confused even when solved similar problem in past? Are you able to grasp problem statement in one go? or get hanged?)
2. You must be [extremely energetic] (Do you raise eyebrows when asked to stretch your limits, both in terms of complexity or extra hours to put in? What comes first in your mind, let's finish it today or this can be done tomorrow too? Its Friday 10 PM at work -Tired?)
3. You must be [honourably honest] (Do you tell others what you think, or what they want to hear? Later is good for sales team for their customers, not for this role. Are you honest with your work? intrinsically with yourself first?)

You know yourself the best. If not ask your loved ones and then decide. We clearly need exceedingly motivated people with entrepreneurial traits, not employee mindset - not at all.

This is an immediate requirement. We shall have an accelerated interview process for fast closure - you would be required to be proactive and responsive.

Problem Statement-Solution

Only 10% of India speaks English and 90% speak over 25 languages and 1000s of dialects.

The internet has largely been in English. A good part of India is now getting internet

connectivity thanks to cheap smartphones and Jio. The non-English speaking internet users

will balloon to about 600 million users out of the total 750 million internet users in India by

2020. This will make the vernacular segment one of the largest segments in the world -

almost 2x the size of the US population. The vernacular segment has very few products that

they can use on the internet.

One large human need is that of sharing thoughts and connecting with people of the same

community on the basis of language and common interests. Twitter serves this need globally

but the experience is mostly in English. There’s a large unaddressed need for these vernacular

users to express themselves in their mother tongue and connect with others from their

community. Koo... is a solution to this problem.

About Koo

Koo was founded in March 2020, as a micro-blogging platform in both Indian languages and

English, which gives a voice to the millions of Indians who communicate in Indian

languages.

Currently available in Assamese, Bengali, English, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil and

Telugu, Koo enables people from across India to express themselves online in their mother

tongues. In a country where under 10% of the population speaks English as a native

language, Koo meets the need for a social media platform that can deliver an immersive

language experience to an Indian user, thereby enabling them to connect and interact with

each other. The recently introduced ‘Talk to Type’ enables users to leverage the voice

assistant to share their thoughts without having to type. In August 2021, Koo crossed 10

million downloads, in just 16 months of launch.

Since June 2021, Koo is available in Nigeria.

Founding Team

Koo is founded by veteran internet entrepreneurs – Aprameya Radhakrishna (CEO,

Taxiforsure) and Mayank Bidawatka (Co-founder, Goodbox & Coreteam, redBus).

Technology Team & Culture

The technology team comprises sharp coders, technology geeks and guys who have been

entrepreneurs or are entrepreneurial and extremely passionate towards technology. Talent is

coming from the likes of Google, Walmart, Redbus, Dailyhunt. Anyone being part of a

technology team will have a lot to learn from their peers and mentors. Download our android

app and take a look at what we’ve built. Technology stack compromises of a wide variety of cutting-edge technologies like Kotlin, Java 15, Reactive Programming, MongoDB,

Cassandra, Kubernetes, AWS, NodeJS, Python, ReactJS, Redis, Aerospike, ML, Deep

learning etc. We believe in giving a lot of independence and autonomy to ownership-driven

individuals.

Problems we Solve

ML@Koo is a small and focused team with the following main objectives:

1. Make Koo a clean and safe platform.

2. Recommend content and ""people to follow"" to users they might be interested in.

3. Make content more discoverable by extracting structures in it, such as topics.

4. Each of the above objectives are open problems, when combined with challenges like

people being creative while being mischievous and working with Indic languages

where not much NLP work has been done. We use the latest technologies to solve

these problems and meanwhile build our own state-of-the-art algorithms.

Job Description

Deep Learning - Engineer/ Research Scholar

Deep Learning Engineer/ Research Scholar specialize in using deep learning platforms for specific types of programming tasks related to artificial intelligence. The goal is to develop programming systems that mimic brain functions. To do this, one needs to use neural networks, which are data structures similar to the structure of the human brain. Although deep learning is considered a subset of machine learning, it's far more sophisticated. The objective is for the machines that operate with deep learning systems to be able to learn without human direction.

Deep learning research engineers be involved in developing system and program design plans and... determining how to integrate machines and programs. They are responsible for developing systems that can transfer data effectively and writing complex computer programming code to direct parts of the neural network to operate properly. They may specifically work on things like predictive to Prescriptive analytics, cognitive science, facial recognition software, computer vision and robots.

Required Education

A master's degree in a relevant field (computer science / statistics)
Clear understanding on fundamentals of AL & ML algorithms and Neural Networks.
Wide range of computer programming exposure including Python, Matlab, Linux and C.

Required Skills

Able to work in AI and ML frameworks and tools (R / TensorFlow / Matlab / etc)
Need strong analytical skills to review systems and code to identify issues or areas for improvement.
Need to have the ability to work as part of a team
Should have strong oral and written communication skills.
Working knowledge of any existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) will be considered as weight factor.

Expected outcome

You are expected to develop your own ideas on education management systems and contribute to the existing research products under development. This will be a great opportunity to improve your research & development skills.
