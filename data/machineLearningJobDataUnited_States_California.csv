Our project demands that our biometric device (the Orb) provides a good user experience and is able to capture high quality biometric data. Our gimballed imaging system that captures the iris from various camera positions is essential for gathering quality data. This role is responsible for development and maintenance of the software that controls the imaging system. This involves the development of computer vision models, their integration on the hardware device, and collecting additional data for the continual improvement of our model’s performance.

In this role you will:
• Interact with the hardware, orb firmware, and data collection teams to design workflows for collecting the training data you need.
• Build custom data labeling services to increase the quality of our training data.
• Setup and train neural networks to solve tasks like localization or semantic segmentation.
• Design techniques to analyze the performance of your engines, find weaknesses, and improve them (e.g. through data augmentation).
• Ensure that the biometric engine performs equally well across different demographics.
• Implement visualization tools and monitoring systems for tracking imaging performance, data drift and edge case robustness
• Setup experiments and do research on iris recognition in general (e.g., measure reaction times of the pupil contraction).

About You:
• Industry experience or PhD in computer vision applications with deep learning, ideally through past projects that have been deployed in production.
• Good understanding of image processing and analysis methods such as edge detection, registration, image quality measures, denoising and image fusion.
• Have an eye for detail in regards to data and label quality.
• Fluent in Python and deep learning libraries (e.g. Pytorch/Tensorflow)
• Well versed with the state-of-the-art in deep learning for computer vision.
• Ability to read and understand scientific papers, reproduce results, and transfer techniques to other domains.

Security Clearance:

This position does not currently require a Department of Energy (DOE) security clearance.

Sandia will conduct a pre-employment drug test and background review that includes checks of personal references, credit, law enforcement records, and employment/education verifications. Furthermore, employees in New Mexico need to pass a U.S. Air Force background screen for access to Kirtland Air Force Base. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause access to be denied or terminated, resulting in the inability to perform the duties assigned and subsequent termination of employment.

If hired without a clearance and it subsequently becomes necessary to obtain and maintain one for the position, or you bid on positions that require a clearance, a pre-processing background review may be conducted prior to a required federal background investigation. Applicants for a DOE security clearance need to be U.S. citizens. If you hold more than one citizenship (i.e., of the U.S. and another country), your ability to obtain a security clearance may be impacted.

Members of the workforce (MOWs) hired at Sandia who require uncleared access for greater than 179 days during their employment, are required to go through the Uncleared Personal Identity Verification (UPIV) process. Access includes physical and/or cyber (logical) access, as well as remote access to any NNSA information technology (IT) systems. UPIV requirements are not applicable to individuals who require a DOE personnel security clearance for the performance of their SNL employment or to foreign nationals. The UPIV process will include the completion of a USAccess Enrollment, SF-85 (Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions) and OF-306 (Declaration of for Federal Employment). An unfavorable UPIV determination will result in immediate retrieval of the SNL issued badge, removal of cyber (logical) access and/or removal from SNL subcontract. All MOWs may appeal the unfavorable UPIV determination to DOE/NNSA immediately. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the MOW may try to go through the UPIV process one year after the decision date.

EEO:

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status and any other protected class under state or federal law.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

At Saildrone, we sustainably explore, map, and monitor the oceans to understand, protect, and preserve our world. Saildrone provides real-time access to critical data from any ocean on earth, 24/7/365, and uses proprietary software applications to transform that data into actionable insights and intelligence. Saildrone’s fleet of uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs), powered by renewable... wind and solar power, have a minimal carbon footprint and operate without the need for a crewed support vehicle. We work with governments, civil agencies, foundations, universities, and private companies around the globe to drive better information about our oceans and seas—from sailing into the eye of a category 4 hurricane to obtain new data about how storms intensify collecting new CO2 data in hard-to-reach areas, and counting fish biomass to inform sustainable fishery management, to mapping the ocean floor and reducing illegal fishing and drug trafficking. As a result of our work, we have been included on Fast Company’s annual list of the “World’s Most Innovative Companies for 2022”, earned the 2022 Ocean Awards’ Innovation Award, won “Best Tech For Good” in the 2022 Timmy Awards, and were recognized by Andreessen-Horowitz’s American Dynamism 50 list of the “Top 50 companies kickstarting American renewal.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of the data for the intended task, designing models that perform to specification, and be able to evaluate the model (architectures, cost-functions, etc.) that will best suit the problem at hand.
• Compare results from various methodologies and recommend the best techniques to stakeholders
• Think in advance of a model's future requirements or how the available data might change over time and design a product that will be able to cope with those requirements. Assume leadership of some, or all, of a product ship.
• Be the ‘go to’ leader in specific methodologies and mentor junior data scientists on the team and share ideas in an open collegiate way.
• Connect and collaborate with subject matter experts in biology, chemistry, and medicine and offer, challenge, and solicit advice via peer review to enhance quality, share best practices and embed innovation.
• Be a model leader in code practice and standards
• Independently translate high-level ideas into reliable, production stable ad testable products, services or features, despite rapidly changing standards, solutions and technology
• Strive for bringing innovation and help building the bridge between data science and molecular biology. Continuously enrich your knowledge with the latest advancements in these fields.

Why you?
