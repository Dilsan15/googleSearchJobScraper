â€¢ Remote and relationships first Nextail has been a remote first company since its beginnings. Yet we believe in the power of direct human interaction. Therefore teams gather in person on a quarterly basis and the Nextail house in the center of Madrid is open all year long to all Nextailers.Periodic company get-togethers to meet the rest of the team.
â€¢ International environment: We operate across the globe, with recent operations reaching from Europe all the way to Australia, and our team alone consists of professionals of more than 23 different nationalities. While many of us are multilingual, our working language is English.
